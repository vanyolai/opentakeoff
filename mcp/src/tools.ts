The engine's arguments are FEET-TRUE through the sheet's scale, exactly the canvas's: gap sealing bridges up to a door-width opening (disclosed as gap_sealed_px — that much boundary is synthetic), door-swing wedges annex the swing a doorway sweeps (door_wedges), and the minimum-passage rule keeps sub-half-foot slits from conjoining two rooms (min_pass_px/min_pass_delta). Every trace carries the engine's own account of itself: confidence (0..1, with confidence_factors naming what deducted) — a review PRIORITIZER, never a verification. 1.0 means every signal ran clean, not that the trace is right; a LOW confidence is a view_sheet {overlay: true} audit prompt, not a fact to bid from — put eyes on the flagged edge before the total means anything. SCANNED sheets work too (#154): where vectors can't bound the room (an image-only scan, or a scan wrapper whose only linework is the title block), the flood falls back automatically to the sheet's rendered pixels — same engine the canvas uses — and the reply plus the committed shape's origin carry raster_traced: true so a pixel-bounded ring is never mistaken for a vector-snapped one. Vector always wins where it works; a raster ring's corners are unsnapped, so audit it with view_sheet {overlay: true} before trusting the total. With the sheet's scale set, returns area_sf / perimeter_lf; pass condition (a finish tag, e.g. "CPT-1") to commit the traced shape to the takeoff — the full engine account rides the committed shape's origin, so the export tells the truth about how each shape was made. Without a scale it returns px-only quantities with a warning and commits nothing (the engine also degrades to its scale-blind fallbacks — a weaker measurement, one more reason set_scale comes first). role "deduct" makes the committed shape subtract.

An OCR'd scan (text layer, no vector linework) floods the rendered pixels instead (#154), disclosed per room and on origin as raster_traced. A seed is only reported as a room once it survives three gates, and everything skipped is counted and reasoned in \`withheld\` — never dropped silently, because a room the tool tells you it skipped is a question you can ask, while one it hides is a hole in a bid. The gates: a flood that leaked or landed in dense linework never becomes a region; two labels flooding the SAME region commit once (the extra labels ride on \`merged_labels\` — double-counting an area is the worst failure an estimating tool has); and a flood that is enclosed and clean but smaller than min_area_sf is a room-number bubble, a door swing, or a wall cavity rather than a room. Every room floods through the SAME sealed engine a single one_click runs (RFC #60 — feet-true gap sealing, door-swing wedges, the minimum-passage rule), so a batch detection and a click at the same seed measure the same square footage; each room carries the engine's account of its own trace (confidence + confidence_factors, gap_sealed_px, door_wedges, min_pass_px/min_pass_delta), and the same account rides origin on everything committed. Confidence is a review prioritizer, never a verification — a low-confidence room is a view_sheet {overlay: true} audit prompt, not a fact to bid from. With the sheet's scale set, returns area_sf/perimeter_lf per room. Every committed room carries the room number it was traced from as the shape's \`label\`, so a sweep arrives already sliced by room — that field is what the Report's per-room grouping and the workbook's floor × room tab read, and it is the one thing about a batch that cannot be recovered downstream if it is dropped. TO COMMIT, choose the honest source of the finish tag: assign_from_schedule: true routes every room through its OWN room-finish schedule row and commits each under the FLOOR finish that row states — when a schedule exists in the set, THIS is the default move, because one agent-chosen tag across N rooms flattens real finish variety into a wrong bid; condition commits every room under that one stated tag (only right when the rooms genuinely share it; role "deduct" makes them subtract). Without a scale, returns px-only quantities per room and commits nothing — the plausibility floor needs real units, so it only applies once a scale is set.

Score ≥ 0.92 is a match; the 0.75–0.92 band comes back in \`withheld\` with a reason — a near-match is a question you answer by LOOKING (view_sheet at its \`at\`), never a silent commit and never a silent drop. RICHER VARIANTS are named, never silent: a placement that reproduces the whole seed but carries >30% extra linework fully inside its footprint (a register against a grille seed — the same outline plus louvers) comes back with its measured \`extra\` fraction on the row — LOOK at those first, they are the classic mislabel; background lines CROSSING the symbol and coincident duplicate ink never trip this. By default such placements still COUNT, because the contained-seed workflow below depends on supersets matching (seed a bare sub-shape, count the richer symbols that contain it, exclude what you don't mean). Pass \`variant_guard: true\` when your seed is the WHOLE symbol — grilles, drains, fixtures marqueed complete — and extra-ink placements demote to \`withheld\` as questions instead of counting; the guard stands down automatically when \`exclude\` counter-examples are in play, since supplying negatives is manual variant discrimination. The seed's own location is reported in \`seed\` and never double-committed. Every proposed placement is scored up to a hard work ceiling sized for pathological sheets, and the reply says which it was: complete true means the count is a total; complete false (with candidates.dropped > 0) means the count is a FLOOR — some placements were never scored — so tighten the seed rect around more distinctive geometry rather than trusting it as a total. Marquee discipline: the rect must hug ONE instance — only segments FULLY inside it define the symbol, so a loose rect that swallows wall linework fingerprints the wall, not the symbol. scope "set" sweeps the WHOLE working set, counting on PLAN-role sheets only (the sheet graph decides): a symbol drawn in a detail, legend, or schedule is a reference drawing and never counts itself — which is also how you seed from one: marquee the assembly on the detail sheet and its plan-sheet occurrences are counted while the detail stays excluded (the exclusion disclosed in \`skipped\`, per-sheet results with per-sheet caps and wall-clock in \`sheets\`). Scale across sheets: the fingerprint is size-true and is never scale-SEARCHED, so a detail drawn at 1-1/2" = 1'-0" is 12× the size of the same mark on a 1/8" plan — when BOTH sheets have a scale set, the exact ratio is computed from them and the seed is resized before matching (reported per sheet as \`scaled\`); when a scale is missing, the sweep runs at 1:1 and SAYS so (\`scale_assumed\`), because an unknown ratio plus a zero count is not evidence of absence. Seeding from a detail/legend/schedule sheet REFUSES outright until both scales are set — that is the case where an unstated ratio silently finds nothing. commit: true (requires condition) commits every match center as an EA count marker through the same path as place_count — the whole sweep (set-wide included) is ONE undo step, each marker carries origin.method "symbol_sweep" with its score, transform, and seed source, and withheld placements are NEVER committed. The SEED instance is not in that count (#296) — in sheet scope it is almost always installed work, so pass commit_seed: true to mint it into the same batch (the reply reminds you whenever a sheet-scope commit leaves it out; ea_total one short of the hand tally is exactly this). The COUNT is scale-free (EA), but matching across sheets of different scales is not — set_scale on the sheets involved is what turns the ratio from an assumption into arithmetic. Counter-examples (#259): drafting reuses one generic shape for different devices — a wall-mounted data outlet drawn as a plain triangle, the flush-floor variant the SAME triangle inside a square, keynote callouts a triangle with a letter in it — so the seed legitimately matches things you do not mean, and seeding more geometry only works where the drawing offers more to capture. \`exclude\` takes rects around instances you do NOT mean, marqueed exactly like the seed. You never choose a mechanism; the rect's contents decide, because both are the same gesture: a rect holding EXTRA linework beyond the seed rejects placements where that extra linework is present too (the box, the letter), and a rect holding no extra linework of its own is read as the line running THROUGH it — a bare ceiling-grid tile whose grid line a real fixture, drawn over it, would BREAK. That second mechanic is not expressible as a seed: only segments fully INSIDE a rect define a symbol, and background structure is long by nature. Every rejection is disclosed in rejected[] — which negative, what fraction of its evidence was found, and the placement — and NEVER counted in found: an exclusion is a judgement, so look at it and reinstate any you disagree with using place_count at its \`at\`. A counter-example that holds no instance of the seed, or holds the seed with nothing extra, is REFUSED rather than silently doing nothing. Stroke luminance (#260): a flattened export strips the layer tree and flattens every pen, but the file still STATES stroke color — a black fixture outline over a grey ceiling grid is unambiguous there even when the geometry is identical (two empty 2 ft grid tiles reproduce a 2×4 fixture's outline exactly). luminance_tolerance (0–254) gates on it: a sheet segment only answers for a seed segment when their stroke luminances are within the stated tolerance (Rec. 709, 0 = black, 255 = white; 32–64 separates black from grey without touching anti-aliasing wobble). OPT-IN and disclosed, in the spirit of tolerance_px — omitted, sweeps score exactly as before; stated, the reply's lum_gate says the seed's own luminance band and names every placement the geometry would have committed and the pen did not, so you can LOOK at what a stated gate cost. Prefer geometry (a counter-example, a tighter seed) where the drawing offers it — color is the fallback for exports where nothing else survived. Labels (#308): for a LABELED family — fixtures, tagged equipment, keyed devices — the drawing already names every instance, and the sweep reads those names: a fixture token written beside a placement, or connected to it by a drawn leader line (leader-following arms only on multi-pen sheets, where the annotation pen separates from the work), comes back as \`label\` + \`label_via\` on the row, and the seed's own tag rides \`seed.label\`. Disclosure in both directions, never a recount: a committed match with NO label while the family is labeled was counted on shape alone (measured case: two 0.97 matches that were valve internals, not drains — LOOK at those first), a withheld row carrying the seed's own tag is the drawing vouching for a near-miss (look, then place_count), and a withheld row named a DIFFERENT tag is a sibling fixture answered, not a missed count. After any batch commit, LOOK at what landed — view_sheet {overlay: true} over the swept area — and audit the markers against the drawing before trusting the EA total. ${COORDS}`,

The count is geometry AND text agreeing: drafting reuses one bubble shape across many marks, so a match counts ONLY when the row's own tag sits within the marker footprint (its bbox rides the match as \`tag_at\` evidence); a match labeled with a SIBLING row's tag is excluded and says whose it is, an unlabeled match is withheld as a question, and a tag drawn with no matching marker is disclosed as text_only. REFUSAL over guessing, with the reason and the fix: no such row; the same key in two tables (ambiguous); a tag drawn on no plan sheet; no repeatable marker linework around the tag — a fingerprint is never guessed from text alone (the fallback is always: marquee one instance with symbol_sweep). commit: true commits the counted matches as EA markers under the row's own key — one undo step for the whole set-wide sweep, every marker carrying origin.assignment {source: "schedule"} plus the anchor and row citation on origin.symbol.seed.

A trace fills to the wall linework, so two rooms across a partition are separated by four to eight inches of nothing — testing for a shared edge finds zero transitions on a real planset. What is there is proximity, in two flavours that mean completely different things:\n\n• BUTT JOINT — the two rings run together inside ONE open space (a lobby that changes from carpet to tile with no wall between). The transition IS that run, and it commits as a linear shape under your tag, origin.derived naming both parent shapes and the measured gap.\n\n• WALL-SEPARATED — the rings run parallel across a partition. The rooms are adjacent, but the transition is NOT the shared wall: it is a threshold, in the doorway, and NOTHING in the trace record says where the doorway is (the flood engine seals openings and reports how MUCH boundary it synthesised, never where). Committing 34 LF of threshold because two rooms share 34 LF of wall would be a wrong bid with a machine's confidence behind it. These come back in \`withheld\` — measured, with their length, their gap in inches, and an \`at\` point — as questions you answer by LOOKING (view_sheet at \`at\`, then measure_line or place_count the threshold yourself). The symbol_sweep doctrine: a near-match is never a silent commit and never a silent drop.\n\nTuning: max_gap_in (default 12) is how far apart two rings can be and still count as adjacent at all — raise it for thick walls, and every extra inch turns more of the plan into wall_separated questions, never into committed LF. min_run_in (default 12) drops corner artifacts. The butt-joint threshold is fixed at one inch and is not a knob: "these two finishes touch" is not a judgement call.\n\nAll-or-nothing, like derive_base: an unknown tag, a transition landing on either source tag, the same tag twice, or a sheet without a scale refuses the whole call before anything commits.

 * `MCP error -32602: Tool one_click disabled`: no stage name, no opener, no
 * next move. A model that reached the tool name from the docs rather than from
 * tools/list has nowhere to go, and it reads as a broken product rather than as
 * a client that needs tools/list_changed.
 *
 * The check we need to reach sits inside the handler McpServer installed in its
 * own constructor, and the SDK exposes no hook to it, so this wraps that
 * handler: delegate, and rewrite ONLY the disabled-tool error. Everything else
 * — dispatch, validation, results, every other error — passes through
 * untouched.
 *
 * Deliberately defensive about the internals it has to touch. If the SDK ever
 * changes shape, the wrapper is not installed and behaviour is exactly what it
 * is today: a bare refusal, which is what we already ship. It never throws on
 * its own account.

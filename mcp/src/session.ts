  /** Batch room detection: read every room-number label off the sheet's text
   *  layer, seed the existing One-Click flood at each, and trace/commit
   *  exactly like oneClick — just N of them from one call instead of N
   *  reasoning-heavy round-trips. Same contract as oneClick: no scale → a
   *  px-only preview per room; no condition → nothing commits (a review
   *  pass, not a proposal-acceptance gate — this server has none).
   *
   *  Withholding — nothing is committed until it survives all three, and the
   *  batch NEVER silently drops work: every withheld seed is counted and
   *  reasoned in `withheld`, because a room the tool knows it skipped is a
   *  question the caller can ask, while a room it skipped silently is a hole
   *  in a bid.
   *    1. degenerate — traced to fewer than 3 vertices.
   *    2. duplicate — two labels flooding one region (a room tagged twice, or
   *       a legend number landing in the same space) trace to an identical
   *       ring. Committing both double-counts the area with no signal, which
   *       is the worst failure mode an estimating tool has. One region commits
   *       once; the collapsed labels ride along on `merged_labels`.
   *    3. bubble — plans draw room numbers inside little boxes, and a seed at
   *       the label floods the label's own BUBBLE: fully enclosed, traces
   *       clean at label size, and is not a room (found live: 25 of 26). Each
   *       label runs a SEED LADDER (anchor first, then label-height offsets)
   *       and bubble rings are rejected scale-free (ring bbox ≈ label bbox) —
   *       so the guard holds even before any scale is set. A label whose
   *       every clean flood was its bubble counts here.
   *    4. implausible — enclosed, clean, non-bubble, and still smaller than
   *       `minAreaSf` (default 5 SF — smaller than any real finished space; a
   *       broom closet is ~10 SF): a door swing or wall cavity. Only applied
   *       once a scale exists, since without one there is no real area to
   *       judge and nothing commits anyway. */

  /** sweep_schedule_row (phase 2) — the estimator's story, honored: a
   * transition type sometimes exists only as a schedule row plus tag markers
   * scattered across the plan sheets. Given the ROW's key, this mints the
   * condition FROM the row (the assign-from-schedule vocabulary: the tag is
   * the schedule's claim, `origin.assignment {source: "schedule"}` with the
   * citation) and sweeps every plan sheet for the marker the tag is drawn as.
   *
   * THE CONTRACT, stated precisely — refusal-honest, never text-to-geometry
   * guessing:
   *   1. The row must exist in a schedule table the sheet graph extracted
   *      (one row — a key defined twice across tables is ambiguous, refused).
   *   2. The tag must be DRAWN on at least one plan-role sheet. A row whose
   *      tag appears nowhere on the plans cannot be geometrically anchored,
   *      and a fingerprint is NEVER guessed from text alone — refused, with
   *      the fix (marquee an instance with symbol_sweep).
   *   3. The fingerprint is the linework around the tag's own drawn
   *      occurrence (a deterministic pad ladder around the text bbox), and
   *      where the tag occurs more than once it must CORROBORATE — recur at
   *      a second occurrence — before it is trusted. No repeatable marker
   *      geometry → refused.
   *   4. A geometric match COUNTS only when the row's own tag text sits
   *      within the marker's footprint — drafting reuses one bubble shape
   *      across many tags, so geometry alone is not identity. A match
   *      carrying a SIBLING row's tag is excluded (disclosed with the tag it
   *      carries); a match carrying no tag is withheld as a question; a tag
   *      occurrence with no matching geometry is disclosed as text_only.
   * Commit is ONE undo step for the whole set-wide sweep. */

  /** Revise a committed shape in place: new geometry, a different condition, a

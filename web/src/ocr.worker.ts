// On-device OCR worker (#469): runs PaddleOCR (PP-OCRv5 mobile, English) off
// the main thread so the canvas stays smooth during a read. A thin shell: the
// download, integrity checks, runtime setup, the tile's ink preprocessing
// for recognition (lib/ocr/ink.ts, #481) and word mapping live in
// lib/ocr/workerCore.ts, tested under Node. This file wires in the browser
// pieces, and wraps ppu's service in splitRecognizer
// (lib/ocr/splitRecognize.ts) so detection reads the tile as rendered and
// recognition the grayed copy. `worker-src 'self'` in the CSP covers it.
//
// The runtime is the same ORT asyncify build voice uses (vite.config.js
// aliases ppu's bare `onnxruntime-web` import to the webgpu entry). Its wasm
// arrives as bytes through the core, from this site or Cache Storage; only
// the small .mjs glue loads by URL. Reads run on single-thread wasm: the
// execution provider is pinned to "cpu" explicitly in OCR_ENGINE_OPTIONS,
// which says why (forcing WebGPU hung engine start in Chrome, no speed gain).

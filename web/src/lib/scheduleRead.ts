// Import from schedule — the reader. A marquee around a finish/material
// schedule is read by the finish reader the sheet graph indexes with, through

// adds rules the whole-sheet index (buildSheetGraph, the MCP's find_schedule
// and resolve_tag) doesn't run — NOT USED rows, codes with a word after them,
// code lines split from the row above, four- and five-letter codes and the
// skipped list (#483) — so a drawn box reads more forms than resolve_tag.
// Import from schedule's raster read (#470) feeds it the on-device reader's
// words as spans, with opts.ocr set (readScheduleSpans); on that read a code
// the reader misread (PT-O1, $SM-1) is repaired here, and the row says what
// was read (read_as, #482), and a "/" it read as "7" in the item's words is
// put back.
// This module turns that table into approval-dialog rows: it refuses tables
// that are another schedule family, names each row's category, and joins the
// cells a row's description is spread over.
//
// The only schedule module that imports the sheet graph: the canvas loads it
// with import() when a marquee is read, and seeds conditions from the light
// scheduleRows.ts.

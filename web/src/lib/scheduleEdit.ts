//
// Why this exists: the scan/OCR ingest path will mis-read finish codes (O↔0,
// I↔1, CPT↔CRT). finish_tag is the identity the canvas dedups on and the code a
// plan callout is matched against, so the estimator has to be able to FIX a
// mangled tag before the condition is created — right in the approval dialog.
// The dialog keeps checkbox state on a STABLE per-row key (not the mutable tag),
// then asks these helpers what each edited tag resolves to.

// Finish codes are conventionally all-caps with no interior runs of whitespace
// (CPT-1, PLAM-2, RES-W). Normalize an edited tag the same way the parser emits
// them so dedup is case/whitespace insensitive and matches what flows to create.

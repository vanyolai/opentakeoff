// Text-run joining — put a tag pdf.js split back together.
//
// pdf.js starts a new text item at every font or style change, and CAD
// exports routinely draw a boxed finish tag as three runs: "WB", "-", "01"
// (the hyphen set in a different font). The pieces touch exactly, so on the
// page it reads WB-01, but every consumer that matches a whole run — find_text,
// the sheet graph's schedule keys, sweep_schedule_row's tag labels, count_marks,
// the Symbol tool's labels — sees three strings and matches none of them.
// Measured on six private commercial finish-plan sets: exact find_text recall on
// finish tags was 0–35% before joining and 100% after on the vector sets.
//
// The rule is ABUTMENT, not proximity: the split pieces sit within a tenth of
// a pixel of each other, while a word space is ≥ 0.25 × the glyph height. So
// two runs join only when they share a direction and a line, are set at about
// the same size, and the gap between them is at most JOIN_GAP × height — no
// space is ever invented, and ordinary words never merge. A run drawn twice
// on top of itself (fake bold) overlaps by its own width and stays separate.
// Two guards keep a tag from swallowing its neighbour where the DRAFTING
// collides (the demo plan's "VCT-1" label overlaps room number "170" by
// 1.6 px, 0.08 × height): overlap tolerance is a hair (JOIN_OVERLAP; split
// pieces measured up to 0.03 × height, a rotated "TL" + "-1"), and a run
// ending in a digit never joins a run starting with one.
//
// Pure and DOM-free, like sheets.ts / oneclick.ts: the MCP's textSpans and the
// canvas's span cache both call it, so canvas and agent read the same text.

// Base raster: enough density for fit-to-view + the first stretch of zoom; sharpness
// past 1:1 comes from the DETAIL VIEW (region re-render), never from a giant full-sheet
// bitmap. Rastering to the browser caps would put a 36×24" sheet at 179MP ≈ 716MB of
// backing store per panel — a 4-up ≈ 2.9GB, which Chrome silently fails to keep
// composited (blank sheet at zoom-out, evicted chrome). Quantities are scale-free
// (verts are normalized and the render factor cancels in the area math), so the budget
// only trades memory for base-layer sharpness. Hi-Res opts a sheet INTO the auto
// budget per-user (the default stays the lean baseline raster).

// without ever holding a giant full-sheet bitmap; the region is ~viewport-sized so the cap
// effectively never binds. Engage compares t.scale × devicePixelRatio (softness starts
// when the raster is upscaled in device px — on a 2× display that's t.scale 0.5, not 1).

// number for the OLD single-region crop render (one pdf.js call regardless
// of margin size, so a bigger margin was nearly free); with #86's tile pool,
// margin scales the TILE COUNT quadratically ((1+2*margin)^2), and a fat
// margin was a real, measured contributor to "buffering takes forever" —
// dropped to 0.25 (2.25x area, ~44% fewer tiles than 0.5) once that shipped.

// A backgrounded/hidden tab can suspend pdf.js's render scheduling indefinitely (promise
// neither resolves nor rejects, no console error — Chrome throttles rAF-gated work in
// hidden tabs). The primary recovery for THAT case is the visibilitychange retry below —
// this is only a backstop for some other, unknown cause of a wedged render, so it's set

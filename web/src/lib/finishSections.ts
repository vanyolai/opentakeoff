// Finish-schedule section headings — the printed band a materials / finish
// schedule sets above a group of rows ("FLOORING", "WALL BASE", "MISC.

// against it (and stores the matched entry as TableRow.section), and the
// Import-from-schedule path maps that entry to a takeoff category.
//
// Only what a schedule actually prints as a section title belongs here. A
// material or surface word ("CARPET", "TILE", "PAINT") is not a section
// heading — a band reading "TILE" says nothing about whether the rows under it
// are floor or wall — so those words are not in the vocabulary, and a row
// under such a band has no section.

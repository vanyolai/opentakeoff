// sheet graph.
//
// Every box is one decision here, from the read plus two facts about the box:
// how many text runs it held and whether the page has a text layer at all.
// Nothing about sign-in or a server goes in — every build routes the same, and
// the box never leaves the device. A box whose text holds no table and has at
// most STRAY_TEXT_MAX_RUNS runs (none, or a few stray labels over a picture)
// goes to the on-device reader (OCR), on any page; more text than that is a
// vector box that missed the schedule, and gets the re-drag hint. The on-device
// read's own answers are worded here too, so every message lives in one place.

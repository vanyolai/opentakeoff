// A single-pixel Bresenham barrier is 8-connected, which provably blocks the

// inside the drawn line (sub-inch at plan scales). Text never blocks fills
// (glyphs are showText ops, not constructPath). The caller owns the

//
// Hatch (2026-07-05): hatch/poché strokes are constructPath linework too, so a
// naive mask traps the fill between hatch lines. The cure is a TIERED mask —
// walls plot bit 1, segments classified as hatch (members of a periodic
// parallel family — classifyHatchSegs) plot bit 2 — plus an escalating flood:
// the primary pass treats both as barrier (bit-identical to the original), and
// when it comes back trapped (tiny/boundary), predominantly hatch-bounded (a
// tile-grid cell), or MODERATELY hatch-bounded (a hatch-lined room — issue #32),
// a second pass re-floods with hatch transparent. The moderate tier is the only
// one bounded: it accepts the re-flood only if the area growth stays within a cap
// (grow-but-verify). If the escalated pass leaks, stays tiny, or balloons, the
// primary result stands — a misclassified wall can never make the tool worse
// than the strict mask.

// ── 2. hatch classification ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// PERIODICITY evidence, decided per stroke (issue #184 item C — replaces the
// parallel-row run heuristic). A stroke is hatch iff it sits INSIDE a local
// periodic lattice of its own family: same-angle, SAME-PEN neighbors at ±p on
// both sides — and the lattice extending to ±2p on at least one side — every
// gap equal to within half a mask cell, for some pitch p at fill scale
// (≤ pitchCapPx, feet-true when the scale is known). That one statement
// replaces five knobs of the old classifier:
//   • run length / regularity band / majority vote — CAD hatch pitch is
//     machine-exact, so gaps match to raster precision or the family isn't
//     hatch; five equal-pitched overlapping rows is the evidence, not ten
//     loosely-similar gaps out-voting their outliers.
//   • tangential-overlap fraction — each lattice neighbor must overlap the
//     stroke at all (≥ half a cell): hatch is an areal fill, so its rows
//     stack; scattered same-angle linework that happens to be evenly offset
//     (door arc chords, dimension ticks) doesn't.
//   • pen-width protect ratio — the pen IS part of the pattern: lattice
//     neighbors must match the stroke's width nibble, so a heavy wall
//     overprinting a hairline family finds no same-pen lattice and stays
//     hard, without a ratio to tune.
//   • span protect ratio — a wall riding a fill's rhythm still needs same-pen
//     equal-pitch neighbors BOTH sides; where it does ride them, the
//     escalation's grow-but-verify cap is the backstop (unchanged).
//   • extremal-row protection — the outermost rows of a fill have no ±p
//     neighbor outside the fill, so they fail the lattice and stay hard for
//     free (tile/hatch edges coincide with walls).
// Curve chords are exempt (bezier AND detected polyline arcs — door swings
// must keep closing gaps, and an arc is never a periodic family); clip-only
// paths are soft outright (invisible ink); filled-not-stroked outlines bound
// SOLID ink (wall poché) and are exempt — making them transparent lets the
// escalated fill cross a solid black band. The half-cell tolerances are the
// raster's own honesty floor (two lines closer than half a cell plot on the
// same cells; offsets carry ~1e-14 float noise — the corpus caught a pitch
// sitting exactly ON the cap splitting on that noise at one resolution), not
// tunables.

// ── 2c. offset annotation rings — the finish tag's own outline ─────────────
// A second, independent reason a stroke is not a wall, and the one that costs
// the most square footage on a real finish plan.
//
// Room-finish sheets label each WALL, not just each room, and the drafting
// convention for that is an inset ring: a hairline offset run parallel to each
// wall a foot or two inside the room, 45° ties at the corners, with the finish
// tag (`P-1`, `P-2`) boxed on the run. It is a closed loop — the tag box
// straddles the line rather than breaking it — so a flood started inside the
// room stops on the ring and the perimeter band between ring and wall is lost.
// On demo/sample-finish-plan.pdf that is EVERY patient room: 137 measures
// 161.3 SF against roughly 200 wall-to-wall, and the band is only measurable
// as its own separate click (the corpus pins one at 20.65 SF).
//
// The hatch classifier cannot see this: a ring is ONE run per wall, and a
// lattice needs five. What identifies it is the pen. The ring is drawn
// hairline and the wall it shadows is drawn heavy — nibble 1 against nibble 2
// on the VA sheet — so the test is: the FIRST stroke you meet walking
// perpendicular off this one, within a couple of feet, on either side, is
// substantially heavier and runs alongside it. A wall fails it (walking inward
// from a wall you meet the ring, which is LIGHTER). A tile grid fails it (the
// neighbour is another grid line at the same pen). Poché fails it on length.
// An interior partition fails it unless it is genuinely shadowing a heavier
// parallel line within two feet, and where it does, the escalation's
// grow-but-verify cap is the backstop — this feeds the SAME soft plane hatch
// does, so the strict pass still treats a ring as a barrier and only an
// escalation that stays bounded and doesn't balloon is ever accepted.
// 2 ft, and the ceiling is set by a DOUBLE-COUNT hazard, not by what rings
// measure. On the VA sheet patient room 137's four rings stand off 1.6–2.18 ft,
// so 2 ft recovers three walls and leaves the west band. Raising the cap to 2.5
// takes that band too — and the bench immediately reports 20.7 SF double
// counted, because a click INSIDE the 1.15 ft band still traces the band alone
// (growing it into the room is an 11× jump, which grow-but-verify rejects), so
// the same floor is now billable twice depending where the estimator clicks.
// Under-measuring is visible on a bid; double-measuring is not. The west band
// needs the sliver rule — a 1.15 ft × 16 ft strip is not a room and should
// escalate unbounded — which is its own change with its own evidence.

// stacked), its witness lines run PERPENDICULAR to everything nearby, and its
// pen weight matches thin partition linework. So One-Click reads the string as
// boundary: the flood leaks into the dimension band beside the building, or a
// witness line crossing a room chops it. Field report, flattened multifamily.
//
// What identifies a dimension string is its ANATOMY, not its pen. Measured on
// two real flattened sets (a Revit multifamily permit sheet at 1/4" = 1'-0",
// 18 px/ft; an AutoCAD-exported commercial finish plan at 3/32" = 1'-0",
// 6.75 px/ft, its linework exploded to ~1 px dashes):
//   • one long straight RUN (measured 4.7–31 ft), text between witnesses —
//     text is showText ops, never vectors, so a real run sits in an EMPTY band;
//   • short WITNESS lines meeting it at 90°, one per dimensioned feature —
//     0.5–1.2 ft on the Revit sheet — spaced at ROOM-scale intervals (never
//     the sub-foot rhythm of hatch, coursing, or stipple);
//   • an oblique TICK or arrow ON the run at each junction: 45° slashes
//     0.94 ft long (heavier pen) on the Revit sheet, ~30° arrow strokes
//     0.34 ft long (same pen) on the AutoCAD sheet;
//   • at every junction, ink CONTINUES PAST the joint — the run overshoots
//     the end witnesses (0.39 ft measured) or the witness extends past the
//     run. A rectangle's corner has neither, which is what separates a
//     two-witness dim from every legend swatch and tag box on the sheet;
//   • nothing runs alongside: a wall face has its partner face 0.33–1 ft
//     away for its whole length, a stacked dim string's neighbour run is
//     ≥ 1.5 ft off (3/8" paper at 1/4" scale) and is another dim, not a wall.
//
// The classifier reassembles collinear CHAINS first (the AutoCAD sheet's
// exploded dashes — same device markPolylineArcs uses for arc chords), then
// accepts a chain as a dim RUN only on the full conjunction: isolated, ≥ 2
// sparse witness junctions each continuing past the joint, ticks at ≥ 2 of
// them (and at least half), and an otherwise-empty band. Every threshold is
// feet-true — this runs only when the sheet scale is known — with small
// absolute px floors where the phenomenon is ink/quantization, not geometry
// (the CLUSTER_FIT_TOL_PX precedent).
//
// Softening is deliberately narrower than evidence: a witness is often drawn
// COLLINEAR with the wall edge it dimensions, and on the Revit sheet the
// 0.25 ft witness-to-wall drafting gap sits BELOW the 0.5 ft dash gaps of the
// sheet's own centreline patterns — no gap threshold separates them — so a
// witness chain that merged into longer linework, or one with a wall-length
// parallel partner of its own, is counted as evidence but never softened.
// Union into the same soft plane as hatch and annotation rings; never
// subtracted; the escalation ladder decides what soft is worth.

  // sits within 2 px of its line. So when the caller supplies positioned

  // headless callers that pass none simply get path A alone), a string is:
  // collinear drawn ink near the text, aligned with the text's own baseline
  // rotation, spanning well past the text — plus its ticks and witness stubs.
  // The wall guards stay: a chain with a wall-length parallel partner is
  // never softened, which also self-protects schedule tables (their row rules

  // Fix: map into the BASELINE render (RENDER_SCALE) before choosing the raster and
  // before quantizing. k is this render's ratio to baseline, and the baseline dims
  // it maps onto come from `page` — the sheet in POINTS.

  // AUDIT F3 — WHY `page`, AND WHY THE FIRST ATTEMPT WAS A NO-OP. The first fix

  // on a CAP-BOUND sheet the cap cancels k outright:

  // — algebraically the OLD formula, render-dependent through imgW. Measured on a
  // 2160×1440 pt sheet (baseline 4320×2880, cap-bound): mask px per POINT came out
  // 1.388888889 at rs 2, 1.388640429 at rs 2.070 and 1.388598256 at the true
  // autoRenderScale 2.0704, and the mask itself grew to 3000×2001 at rs 5.374.
  // Zero mask cells differed fix-vs-nofix, and the VA plan still drifted up to
  // −7.03% across the Hi-Res toggle. Sub-cap it was not a no-op but still ±1 cell:
  // 1225×1585 at rs 2.07 where the RASTER mask of the same sheet is 1224×1584, so
  // the two masks of one sheet sat on different grids and one click yielded three
  // SFs at the ~0.02% level.
  // With `page`, the baseline dims are `ceil(pageDim · baseScale)` — identical at
  // every render scale — and k = baseScale/renderScale exactly (no ceil, and no
  // dependence on a calibration having happened yet). Mask px per point is then a
  // constant 1.388888889 / 3000×2000 at every rs above, and the vector grid equals
  // `rasterMaskScale`'s by construction (both call `baselineImgDims`).
  //

// tracing it by hand. Sealing is a hard-bit (wall) box dilation: radius r
// closes gaps up to ~2r px in MASK space, and with GAP_BRIDGE_MAX = 2 only
// pinholes ≤ ~4-5 px ever seal. A real doorway is tens of mask px wide at
// any plausible drawing scale, so it keeps leaking at every radius and an
// open floor plan is never fenced into a fake room. The traced ring sits
// ≤ r px inside the true wall line; snapVertices pulls the corners back onto
// true endpoints, and the rescue rides provenance (`gapBridged` →
// origin.gap_bridged_px) rather than passing itself off as a clean fill.

// (wall) cells dilated by an escalating radius r — a square dilation closes any
// passage up to 2r mask px wide — then grow the bounded region back r steps
// against the ORIGINAL mask so the boundary still sits on the true linework
// everywhere except across the sealed opening (where the fill may reach up to
// r px past the wall ends — sub-inch at plan scales, and the seed star + review
// gate still apply). Soft (hatch) cells are never dilated: thickening a hatch
// family would fuse the pattern into a solid block and starve the fill.
//
// Every non-"ok" status gets a sealing attempt — not just "leak". A hatched
// room behind a doorway reads as TINY, not leak: the strict pass is trapped by
// the hatch, and the escalated walls-only pass leaks through the door and is
// discarded. On the sealed mask that same escalation is bounded and succeeds.

// ── 4c. door-swing inclusion — measure to the wall opening ─────────────────
// A drawn door (leaf + swing arc) bounds the flood, which keeps rooms from
// merging through their doorways — but the swing wedge behind the arc IS floor
// the estimator must count: flooring runs under the door. The wedge is NOT an
// enclosed pocket (its far edge is the open doorway itself), so it cannot be
// annexed by flooding "behind the arc" — that walks straight out the opening.
//
// Instead, doorways UNIFY: re-flood with CURVE cells (bit 4) transparent so
// the arc no longer bounds the room, and let gap sealing close the doorway at
// the wall plane exactly as it would a cased opening. The result reads to the
// threshold, wedge included, neighbor still excluded — with every sealing
// sanity gate in force.
//
// PER ARC, not all at once (adversarial review, round 8): a room ringed by
// several open doorways used to open every boundary arc in one retry — the
// combined growth blew the allowance, the whole retry was rejected, and a
// multi-door room lost every wedge (~a quarter-circle of real floor per
// door). Now each arc CLUSTER (connected curve cells; dash gaps bridge)
// retries independently and its acceptance is bounded by the arc's OWN
// GEOMETRY, re-fitted from the cluster's cells (arcClusterFit →
// wedgeAllowance): the sector the leaf sweeps about the fitted hinge, boxed in
// the arc's CHORD FRAME, capped at two 5-ft doors' worth.
//
// The claim that used to stand here — that a curved wall's thin box could
// never admit the closet behind it — was FALSE, and this is the correction.
// The box was AXIS-ALIGNED, so a diagonal shallow arc got a near-square one;
// the ceiling was a constant ≈51 SF at every scale that ignored the arc's own
// radius; and the rim was denominated in mask px. A 30 ft wall with a 2.5 ft
// bulge annexed the whole ~50 SF behind it, at 0.97 confidence, labelled
// "incl. door swing", with no door anywhere in the scene. What actually keeps
// a curved wall honest is its RADIUS: 46 ft is not a door leaf, and a cluster
// that fits one clean circle of non-leaf radius gets no allowance at all.

// ── separating two doors that the bridge glued together (in-swing wedges) ────

// to stay. But two doors meeting near a corner — a patient room's own door and
// its toilet's, hinged a couple of feet apart — come within three cells of each
// other too, and then one cluster holds two arcs. Every consequence of that is
// bad, and they compound:
//   • arcClusterFit puts ONE circle through both, so the fit is garbage
//     (measured on demo/sample-finish-plan.pdf, patient room 138: 120 cells,
//     241° sweep, rms 10.35, good=false, where a clean single door reads ~40
//     cells / 89° / rms 0.31);
//   • good=false drops doorLikeness from 8.0 to 1.0, so a real pair of doors
//     ranks below anything with a clean fit and can lose the budget entirely;
//   • good=false also takes wedgeAllowance's fallback branch, which is far
//     LOOSER than either door deserves;
//   • and the retry opens both arcs at once, so the re-flood has two openings
//     to get through and the seal ladder has to close both or nothing is
//     annexed. Room 138 measured 159.4 SF against 190–228 for its neighbours —
//     its own swing sector, cut off by the leaf, never came back.
//
// The cure is to split ONLY what fails the fit, and then to put back together
// whatever the split shouldn't have separated. A dashed arc's pieces all lie on
// the SAME circle, so re-fitting each piece and re-merging pieces whose centre
// and radius agree reconstructs it exactly; two doors have centres feet apart

// ── the IN-SWING sector, and why opening the arc could never reach it ────────
// A drawn door is two marks: the LEAF (a straight double line from the hinge to
// where the panel stands open) and the ARC (the swept edge, hinge-centred,
// running from the leaf's tip round to the closed jamb). The sector between
// them is floor — flooring runs under a door — and which mark separates it from
// the room depends entirely on which way the door swings:
//
//   OUT-swing — leaf and sector are on the CORRIDOR side. The room's boundary
//     at the doorway is the opening itself, and the ARC is what closes it.
//     Opening the arc and re-flooding re-measures the room to the wall. This is
//     what the retry has always done, and it works.
//
//   IN-swing — leaf and sector are INSIDE the room. The room's boundary at the
//     doorway is the LEAF. The arc is on the far side of the sector, closing it
//     off from the corridor. Opening the arc lets the room out toward the
//     corridor; it does not, and cannot, reach the sector, because the leaf
//     still stands between them. Every in-swing door on a plan therefore lost
//     its sector no matter how the cluster ranked — measured on
//     demo/sample-finish-plan.pdf, patient room 138 read 159.4 SF against
//     190–228 for its neighbours.
//
// So the in-swing retry opens the LEAF and leaves the arc hard. That is not
// just the correct mark, it is the SAFE one: with the arc still standing, the
// sector is completely enclosed by leaf-gone + arc + jamb, so the re-flood can
// gain the sector and nothing else. There is no opening for it to escape
// through and no dilation needed to close one. On an out-swing door the leaf is
// not on the room's boundary at all, so opening it changes nothing — the arc is
// still there sealing the doorway — which is exactly the "don't disturb what
// already works" property this needs.

 *
 *  WHY THIS EXISTS. #191 opens a door's leaf as its own flood opening, on the
 *  reasoning that the in-swing sector is enclosed by leaf-gone + arc + jamb so
 *  the re-flood "gains the sector and nothing else", and that on an out-swing
 *  door "the leaf is not on the room's boundary, so opening it changes
 *  nothing". Both statements are about a LEAF. Neither holds for what the ray
 *  finder returns on a DOUBLE door: two leaves fit ONE circle whose sweep is
 *  ~180 degrees, and the extreme angles of that sweep point at the two JAMBS
 *  rather than at a panel tip, so the ray lands along the WALL and comes back
 *  as a short stub of it. Opening that stub punches a hole in the room's own
 *  wall; the re-flood then walks out through the doorway and annexes the swing
 *  sector on the FAR side — floor belonging to the space the doors swing into.

// `minPassPx` > 0 turns on the feet-true minimum-passage rule: the PRIMARY
// flood runs against walls dilated by that radius (closing sub-MIN_PASS_FT
// slits — see minPassRadiusFor), grown back onto the true linework. This is a
// SEMANTIC default, not a repair: whether a hair-width slit connects two
// spaces must be a property of the drawing, never of the mask resolution. If
// the dilated flood fails (open space still leaks; the dilation ate a
// sliver-sized region), everything falls back exactly to the old behavior:
// raw flood first, then the seal ladder — sealing still only ever improves.
//
// AUDIT A3. The min-passage path is a DILATION path — the same machinery the
// seal ladder runs, at a smaller radius — and for a year it took neither of
// the ladder's two sanity gates and reported no provenance at all. Because
// minPassPx > 0 on every scaled sheet, that made the ladder's advertised
// "room-size cap + ≥75%-real-boundary" guarantee vacuous on the PRIMARY path:
// a region the ladder would have refused was returned unguarded, with
// sealedPx/virtualFrac unset, so the readout said nothing and traceConfidence
// scored it a verbatim 1.00. The path now reports itself:
//   • minPassPx    — the radius that ran, whenever the rule changed the answer
//   • minPassDelta — the fraction of the VERBATIM flood's region the rule
//                    removed: 1 − minPass.count / rawFlood.count, and 1 when
//                    the verbatim flood produced no bounded region at all
//                    (the rule is then the only reason there is a measurement).
// Both are only set when minPassDelta > 0. The rule runs on essentially every
// scaled click and usually changes nothing; provenance for "a rule ran and did
// not matter" is noise, and a confidence deduction for it would be a lie.
//
// AUDIT F1/F2 (post-A3 review). A3 also applied both of the ladder's gates
// here UNCONDITIONALLY, and that was a regression, because the two paths ask
// different questions. Which one this is turns on a single fact — does the
// VERBATIM linework already bound the clicked space?
//
//   • it does (minPassDelta < 1) — the rule is TRIMMING. Its region is then a
//     SUBSET of the verbatim flood's (the dilation only ever removes open
//     cells, ascendSeed stays in the seed's own open component, and growback
//     re-enters only cells open on the original mask), so:
//       – the room-size cap is arithmetically redundant: the superset already
//         passed it;
//       – the ≥75%-real-boundary cap is satisfied IN KIND, not by luck: every
//         synthetic run on this path bridges a gap the rule itself just judged
//         narrower than MIN_PASS_FT, so no virtual run is even door-width. The
//         cap is a proxy for run LENGTH; here run length is bounded a priori.
//     A high fraction therefore means "many sub-half-foot slots" — a dashed or
//     picket wall — and refusing it does not buy safety, it hands back the
//     LEAKIER superset. Measured: a 0.433 ft slotted wall inside a suite went
//     64.4 SF → 126.6 SF (+96%) and confidence 0.99 → 1.00, because the raw
//     flood fell out of the bottom of the gate carrying no provenance at all.
//     So on the trimming path the gates do not run. (test/minPassGate.test.ts)
//   • it does not (minPassDelta === 1) — the rule is CREATING boundedness: not
//     trimming a hairline connection but BRIDGING an opening, which is the seal
//     ladder's job under another name. Both gates run, exactly as they do for a
//     ladder rung, and an accepted region reports gap_sealed_px + the ladder's
//     own virtual-boundary fraction beside min_pass_px.
//
// Because the gates now run only when the verbatim flood is unbounded, the
// fall-through below can no longer return a bounded raw flood that a gate
// refused: `base` is bounded only when the min-passage flood produced no
// bounded region at all, and then there is nothing to report.

// ── 6b. THE PRODUCTION RING ────────────────────────────────────────────────
// `traceRegion` is NOT what the product returns. Every vector One-Click ring in
// the product is trace-THEN-SNAP, and `area_sf` is computed from the SNAPPED
// ring.
//
// Audit A5b measured the cost of composing that by hand: `bench/run.mts` and
// `bench/pin-goldens.mts` called bare `traceRegion` and never imported
// `snapVertices` at all, so EVERY engine-pinned golden pinned a number the
// product never displays — the bench read 117.568 SF on a room the product
// (and e2e/one-click.e2e.cjs, through real Chromium) measures at exactly
// 120.000. The long-standing "1,751.9 vs 1,744.7" sample-plan discrepancy was
// this, not sloppiness: 1,751.9 is the snapped production reading.
//
// So the composition lives HERE, once. AUDIT F7(b): for one release it lived
// here and NOTHING production called it — the five sites still composed the two
// calls by hand, the only callers were the bench and a source-scan test that
// asserted the hand-composed COUNT, and this comment nonetheless claimed "every
// surface … calls this". The five are now converted, so the sentence is earned:
// the callers are TakeoffCanvas.jsx (propose / live-preview / agent tool),
// mcp/src/session.ts (one_click / detect_rooms), bench/run.mts and
// bench/pin-goldens.mts — seven call sites, no hand-composed ones left, and
// web/test/benchProductionRing.test.ts scans the two production files to keep it
// that way. Same reasoning as confidence.ts's `floodSignals`: a hand-listed call
// site is a call site that goes stale.

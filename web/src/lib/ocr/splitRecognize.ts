// The split read (#481): ppu-paddle-ocr's detection on one canvas, its
// recognition on another. The worker hands detection the tile as rendered and
// recognition a copy with its colored pixels grayed (ink.ts says why).
//
// ppu has no public way to do that, so this mirrors PaddleOcrService
// .recognize() of the pinned ppu 6.6.0 (core/base-paddle-ocr.service.js)
// through two of its protected fields, detector and recognitor, present at
// runtime. For a canvas with noCache it does: boxes = detector.run(canvas);
// no boxes gives the empty result; dict = options.recognition
// .charactersDictionary; strategy = the read's, else the service's, else
// "per-line"; results = recognitor.run(canvas, boxes, dict, strategy,
// options); then groupResultsByLine(results). This does the same, with
// recognition's canvas swapped. Not mirrored, because the worker uses none of
// them: ppu's result cache, flatten: true, a per-read dictionary, and string
// or ArrayBuffer images. test/ocrSplitRecognize.test.ts pins ppu's version
// and that source, so an upgrade that changes recognize() fails there.
//
// The package's exports map doesn't expose this subpath, so it's imported by
// path; the file has no imports of its own.

// Tiled OCR reads and their seams (#471). Pure and DOM-free: the renders and
// the engine run elsewhere (rasterize.ts, the worker); this plans the rasters
// and joins what they read, so a page too big for one raster reads as if it
// were one.
//
// A read covers `rect` (image px at the sheet's render scale `rs`, like a
// marquee). planTiles cuts it into balanced cores that partition it,
// half-open [x0,x1) and closed at the rect's far edge, and renders each core
// with `overlapPt` points of overlap, sized so every raster reaches the
// target DPI exactly (ocrRenderFactor never has to shrink it).
//
// The engine returns text lines, not words, so a seam can cut a long line.
// A line is *near* a raster's inner edge (a side not on `rect`) when it is
// within max(3 render px, h) of it: ppu rounds its boxes, and the engine
// drops a glyph the edge cuts, box and all, so a cut line can end short of
// the edge by up to a capital's advance (0.64–0.79·h measured on the demo
// plan; see nearMargin).
//   • A line near no inner edge is whole. It is kept once: from the tile
//     whose core holds its centre if whole there, else from any tile where
//     it is whole (admit: a duplicate is another read's line with IoU ≥ 0.5,
//     or one that holds it and its text; a longer read of the same ink
//     replaces the shorter; two reads of one row as overlapping pieces,
//     each cut past the near margin, are joined into one line when their
//     texts overlap by the width their boxes do; see mergeRow).
//   • A fragment (near an inner edge) that kept lines account for is
//     dropped. What is left belongs to true straddlers, grouped by line.
//     Each group's patch is sized to the line (its fragments, and kept lines
//     it runs into on its row) plus end margins; the axis comes from the
//     edge the fragment is near. Across, each edge sits in the widest clear
//     gap between the rows beside the band, so it cuts no neighbour's ink.
//     Neighbouring groups on one seam share a
//     patch while it fits the cap both ways, so a table across a seam is one
//     raster, not one per row. From a patch, lines in a group's band and
//     over one of its fragments join `kept` through admit, patch by patch.
//   • A line longer than a patch holds (about 19 in at 216 DPI) is kept as
//     its fragments, flagged `clipped`, and so is any fragment its patch
//     didn't read back. Nothing a tile read is silently lost.
// A seam in a gap between words wider than the near margin, on a row with no
// straddler, gives two kept lines (each whole): the text is right, the line
// is split.
//
// Vertical lines are handled on the same rules, with h the box's short side
// (a vertical line's h is its length); the engine reading them isn't shown.
//
// createSeamRun is the step driver regionRead uses: next raster, its words,
// progress in two phases (tiles n/N, then seams n/M).

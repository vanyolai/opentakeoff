// On-device OCR vocabulary (#469). Pure and DOM-free, like scheduleParse.ts:

// them to the sheet graph's finish reader as the spans a text layer would
// give it (Import from schedule's raster read, #470), and wordsToTokens to
// the token parser, so neither reader learns whether a schedule was vector or
// a raster image.

 * the text layer's Tokens (sheets.extractRegionText): x is the left edge, y
 * the bottom (y grows down), h the height, so the word spans [y − h, y]. The
 * numbers come from the detector's text region with ppu's padding taken off
 * (raster.unpadCropBox): y is the bottom of that region, meant to be the
 * bottom of the ink, which is the baseline except where a descender (g, p,
 * y) hangs below it. How closely the detector's region hugs the ink, and so
 * the text layer's baseline, isn't measured yet. w is the width, carried
 * into Token.w; span-based readers need it (textlines tells a word gap from
 * a column gap on it). */

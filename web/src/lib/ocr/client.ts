// Main-thread client for the on-device OCR worker (#469). Owns the worker's
// life cycle; callers never touch the worker. Nothing loads until a caller
// asks: probe() is one small same-origin GET, and the worker starts only once
// the files are cached or the person has agreed to download them.
//
// Consent isn't stored. The client checks Cache Storage instead: if every
// file is cached, the engine starts without asking; if the browser evicted
// the cache, the download notice comes back. The worker enforces the same
// rule, so a cache evicted between the probe and the start still asks.
//
// Reads queue first in, first out, and the worker runs one at a time, so two
// features can share one engine. App code must use that one shared engine,
// getOcrClient(), never a client of its own: two clients would build two
// engines, each holding its own models. createOcrClient is for tests.
//
// Starts are shared, answers are per call. Callers that ask while a start is
// running wait on that same start, each with its own signal, progress and
// consent. Aborting detaches only that caller; the worker's download is
// cancelled once no caller wants it any more. Only a caller that passed
// consent keeps a network download going: when the last one leaves, the rest
// hear consent-required. A caller without consent that joins a download
// waits for it like anyone else. And if a caller brings consent to a start
// that would end consent-required, the start goes on with the download.
//
// A read the worker never answers would hold the queue, and whenIdle, for
// good (#484). Each posted read has a deadline, readDeadlineMs: generous,
// since a false timeout costs a read and a hang costs everything after it,
// and stretched to this device's own speed once it has read 1 MP or more.
// When it passes, the read rejects OcrTimeoutError, the worker is ended and
// the engine restarts from the cache. The reads queued behind it wait for
// the restart, as does whenIdle, and go to the new worker. A restart never
// downloads, whoever joins it: with the files evicted it ends
// consent-required. It has its own deadline. If it fails, or a second read
// times out with none answered in between, the queue rejects and the next
// ensureReady starts afresh. A timed-out read is never sent again, so the
// second hang is a different raster: two in a row mean the engine can't
// cope here, and restarting on would make every queued read wait out a
// deadline in turn. Both deadlines count only time the page is
// visible, since a browser throttles a background tab: a hang in a hidden
// tab is bounded only once the tab is visible again.
//
// dispose() is final: pending and later ensureReady calls resolve aborted,
// and no worker is started again.

// Import from schedule — reading a box on-device (#470). When scheduleRoute
// sends a box to the on-device reader (no table in its text layer, and at most
// a few stray runs), the canvas hands this the box's steps and gets back what
// the box becomes: rows, a message, or "cancelled" (the person left: Cancel,
// another sheet, the canvas closed), which shows nothing.
//
// Pure: every step is injected, so this touches no DOM, worker or pdf.js.
//   0. tooLarge(): a box past the reader's tile cap is refused before
//      anything starts (no download notice for a read that can't run);
//   1. session.run starts the engine the way the person agreed (lib/ocr/
//      session.ts: cached files start at once, else the download notice, and
//      only its Download downloads);
//   2. whenIdle(), when given (the OCR client's): the engine reads one thing
//      at a time, so a page read or a copy read (#471) under way goes first.
//      onWaiting() says so on the status line while it waits; Cancel ends
//      the wait at once (the client's wait takes no signal, so it is raced
//      against the session's). Then onReading() — the status line says
//      "Reading" from here on;
//   3. readWords() reads the box (lib/ocr/boxRead.ts: tiled at 216 DPI, as a
//      page read is) and returns its words; it gets the session's signal, so
//      Cancel stops a render or read under way, and reports progress, passed
//      on to onProgress while the read is wanted;
//   4. read() is the sheet graph's finish reader (readScheduleSpans with
//      { ocr: true } on the canvas), fed the words as spans (wordsToSpans),
//      and routeOcrRead words the result (given the spans too, so no table
//      over a column of codes says the header row is what's missing).
// Before each step and once more after the session answers, a read that is no
// longer wanted (the signal aborted, or isCurrent() false: the canvas moved on
// to another sheet) stops. Inside the task that is a throw of the private
// STALE sentinel, which the session reports as `failed` (or `aborted` once the
// signal has fired); both come back here as "cancelled", never as a failure.
// So does any failure while the read is no longer wanted: boxRead.ts aborts
// its read when a render lands for a sheet the canvas has left, and that
// AbortError is reported `failed` (session.ts reports only the caller's own
// abort as `aborted`). An AbortError nobody asked for (the page closed
// during the read) is cancelled too.

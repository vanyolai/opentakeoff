# Driving OpenTakeoff from an AI agent (MCP)

OpenTakeoff ships an [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server—[`mcp/`](../mcp/README.md)—that
puts the real takeoff engine on stdio for your MCP client. Not a wrapper around the UI: the server imports shared
`web/src/lib` geometry, calibration and quantity modules. Its measurements
round-trip into the app as normal saved takeoff records. Room-detection paths
currently differ between MCP and the browser; shared quantity math does not
guarantee that the two detectors choose identical boundaries.

This page walks the surface in depth, in the order an agent reaches for it. Two
shorter reads sit either side of it: [`AGENT_GUIDE.md`](AGENT_GUIDE.md) is the
operating manual—how a takeoff is run, what withholds, what refuses—and
[`mcp/README.md`](../mcp/README.md) is the tool-by-tool reference.

> **One-Click is temporarily gated.** `one_click` and `detect_rooms` are not registered on a
> default build while the flood engine is re-validated against a wider plan corpus; the server
> says so in its initialize instructions and points at `measure_polygon`. Set
> `OPENTAKEOFF_ONE_CLICK=1` to register them. The passages below that use the two verbs describe
> that lifted build. See [`design/ONE_CLICK_GATE.md`](design/ONE_CLICK_GATE.md).

## Setup

```bash
cd web && npm install        # the engine's pdf.js lives here
cd ../mcp && npm install
```

Register the server with your MCP client (any stdio client):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "opentakeoff": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["--import", "tsx", "/absolute/path/to/opentakeoff/mcp/server.ts"]
    }
  }
}
```

Never point a client config at `npm start`—npm's banner goes to stdout,
which is the MCP wire. `node --import tsx` is the whole invocation.

By default the server hands every client every tool schema at once. Set
`OPENTAKEOFF_MCP_STAGED_TOOLS=1` in the server's environment to stage the
surface instead: only the setup tools start enabled, and the agent opens the
`measure` / `revise` / `handoff` groups on demand with `open_tool_stage` as
the takeoff reaches them—details in
[`mcp/README.md`](../mcp/README.md#staged-tool-exposure-opt-in). Needs a
client that honors `tools/list_changed`; leave it unset otherwise.

## What the agent gets

Fifty-two tools, in the order an agent tends to reach for them:

- **Open and orient**—`load_plan`, `sheet_info` (including the sheet's PDF
  layer table—Optional Content Groups with a classified role, confidence,
  and default visibility per layer), `set_scale`, `sheet_context`,
  `get_sheet_vectors` (the sheet's vector layer exactly as the engine is fed
  it—flat points, meta byte, luminance, subpath and layer index per segment,
  paged with an exact `dropped` count—so a reader can run its own geometry
  against what the app sees; refuses on a scan, #367)
- **Load the set**—`load_plan` (default replaces; `merge: true` adds—plans +
  schedule + addenda as one working set, #152)
- **Navigate the set**—`sheet_graph` (the plan-set index: sheet roles with
  evidence, schedule tables found, every room tag with its name, detail
  callouts—how an agent decides *what* to measure without a human
  enumerating the rooms), `resolve_tag` (one room tag → its room-finish
  schedule row → each code's finish/material definition, every edge carrying
  a citation; unresolved comes back *with a reason*, never as silence),
  `find_schedule` (kind → sheet + title + headers + a `view_sheet`-ready
  region; kinds are `room finish`, `finish`/`material`, and `equipment` —
  the device schedules of any trade, fans and pumps and heaters and light
  fixtures and plumbing fixtures and diffusers alike, keyed by mark and
  proven by a device column such as CFM, WATTS, GPM, LAMPS or NECK; every
  stacked schedule on a sheet is read, top to bottom). Real-set shapes are handled natively (#87 phases 2–3): a
  schedule **continued across sheets** ("… SCHEDULE — CONT'D") reads as ONE
  table—rows resolve regardless of which sheet carries them, each citing
  the sheet the ink is on, and `find_schedule` returns one match whose
  `parts` list every fragment; **rotated column headers** (a quarter-turn
  header band) anchor the table and are flagged `rotated_headers`; and on a
  **multi-building set** the room key is (building, number), not the number
  alone—rooms and tables carry their building, an unqualified reused
  number refuses *listing the candidate rows per building* instead of
  first-matching, and a qualified tag (`"A-134"`) picks the building the
  set names; and **revision markers**—a text marker (`Δ2`, `REV 2`) or a
  **drawn delta** (a bare digit inside a digit-scale triangle of linework—the
  common CAD convention, proven from the sheet's vector geometry and
  flagged `drawn: true`) beside a schedule row or a room bubble attaches
  there and rides
  `resolve_tag` as `revisions` (the codes returned are the post-revision
  answer, but the ink changed under that delta—view the marker and check
  the addendum before pricing), the set-wide list is `sheet_graph.revisions`,
  `find_schedule` counts `revised_rows` per table, and a marker never bands
  into a cell or mints a room key. A revision **cloud** with no text marker
  is linework—invisible to this text-layer pass, and stated as such rather
  than guessed at. Real-set column shapes are read too (#87 phase 3b, every
  one of them found by running a real bid set): a **two-tier header**—a
  merged `WALLS (PLAN DIRECTION)` parent over `N | E | S | W`—anchors each
  sub-column under its parent as `WALLS N` … `WALLS W` with real bounds, so a
  left-aligned wall code never lands in the narrow BASE column beside it; a
  neighboring legend cannot bleed into the last column; finish tables headed
  `SYMBOL` (no CODE, no MARK) extract and chain; and a **DOOR / WINDOW /
  PARTITION schedule is refused as a finish table** by title—those carry a
  MARK column too, and a finish code chaining to a door mark is a confidently
    wrong product—with the refusal named in `notes`. How this is measured, what
  it scores, and what it still cannot read: [docs/SHEET-GRAPH-EVAL.md](SHEET-GRAPH-EVAL.md)
- **Measure**—`one_click`, `detect_rooms` (both take `layers {include,
  exclude}` to override the sheet's stated layer roles for a call),
  `measure_polygon`, `measure_line`, `measure_surface` (wall SF: an open run
  × the condition's height—the H knob), `place_count` (EA markers, no scale
  required)—all five of the engine's measure roles—plus `symbol_sweep`
  (marquee ONE example of a repeated plan symbol—a drain, a threshold
  marker—and every placement is found deterministically from the vector
  linework, under rotation and mirroring, scored against a commit bar with
  near-misses *withheld with reasons*; `commit: true` places the matches as
  EA count markers in one undo step; `scope: "set"` sweeps the whole working
  set counting on plan-role sheets only, so the seed can be the assembly on a
  detail or legend sheet—the fingerprint source, itself never counted, its
  exclusion disclosed) and `sweep_schedule_row` (take a mark off from its
  schedule row: the row is read as the condition's cited source, the marker
  the tag is drawn as is fingerprinted at a drawn occurrence—corroborated
  at a second one where the set allows—and every plan sheet is swept, a
  match counting only where geometry AND the row's own tag text agree;
  markers labeled with a sibling key are excluded and say whose they are,
  unlabeled ones are withheld as questions, and a row whose tag cannot be
  geometrically anchored is *refused with the reason*—a fingerprint is
  never guessed from text alone). Scanned sheets work
  (#154): where vectors can't bound the room—an image-only scan, or a scan
  wrapper whose only linework is the title block—`one_click` and
  `detect_rooms` fall back automatically to flooding the sheet's rendered
  pixels with the same raster engine the canvas uses, disclosed as
  `raster_traced` on the reply and on the shape's origin; vector always wins
  where it works, and a raster ring's corners are unsnapped (a scan has no
  true endpoints)
- **Derive**—the quantities that follow from rooms already committed, instead
  of measuring them a second time. `derive_base` mints base LF per room
  (perimeter *minus the door openings you state*—your claim, recorded on
  `origin.derived`; the tool never guesses a door). `derive_transitions` mints
  the line where two finishes meet, and is built around a fact worth knowing
  before you call it: **flood-traced rooms do not share edges.** A trace fills
  to the wall linework, so two rooms across a partition sit four to eight inches
  apart and a shared-edge test finds nothing. What is there is proximity, in two
  kinds that are never conflated—a **butt joint** (rings running together
  inside one open space, within an inch) *is* the transition and commits; a
  **wall-separated** run means adjacent rooms whose transition is a threshold in
  a doorway, and nothing in the trace record locates a doorway (the flood engine
  reports how *much* boundary it sealed, never where). Those come back in
  `withheld` with their length, their gap in inches, and an `at` point to
  `view_sheet`—questions to answer by looking, and `withheld_lf` is never
  folded into `total_lf`. Both refuse all-or-nothing and land as one undo step.
  `apply_rules` re-runs the **correction rules** an estimator taught the canvas
  (#88)—"every room like this loses the mechanical chase"—which arrive with
  `import_takeoff` and are never minted over the wire (a rule *is* an
  estimator's correction; minting stays behind the canvas's human
  Preview→Apply gate). Evaluation is the same pure `rules.ts` engine the
  canvas Preview runs, the commit is the one batch its Apply makes
  (`reviewed: false`, one undo step), the per-rule disclosure in the reply is
  the preview an agent gets, and re-running is idempotent by construction—anything
  an existing deduct covers is dropped by the engine
- **Cut**—`cut_out` puts a real hole in a committed floor shape, the way the
  canvas's Eraser does (#137): the same `cutout.js` boolean subtract, so the
  parent's net is set subtraction (overlapping cuts never double-deduct) and a
  hole *adds* perimeter. The ring must sit fully inside the parent—an
  edge-crossing cut is a boundary correction and refuses (the canvas clips it;
  over the wire the rule is refusal-over-guessing). One undo step restores
  parent and hole together, and deleting the deduct later reverts the cut
  (multi-cut parents rebuild from the pristine snapshot minus survivors—the
  canvas's own delete semantics, ported as the spec)
- **Revise**—`edit_shape` (all five roles), `edit_materials`,
  `edit_condition` (waste %, ×N multiplier, `height_ft`, `rise_ft` / `drop_ft` — the vertical legs every linear run adds to its plan length (#441), and the roll-goods
  `roll_setup` opt-in—the reply echoes the figured order), `delete_shape`,
  `undo_last`, with `list_shapes` as the mid-session inventory the mutating
  verbs assume you have
- **Proposals** (#365)—`propose_takeoff` opens a named batch that every
  commit after it attaches to (the estimator sees ONE Accept per batch, not
  one per shape); `revise_proposal` replaces the batch's still-pending shapes
  as one journal step and `withdraw_proposal` removes them, accepted shapes
  untouched either way. `propose_condition_edit` holds a diff against a
  condition (tag, waste, multiplier, height, roll setup) pending the
  estimator's acceptance in the canvas—nothing changes until then, and the
  summary and report carry the diff beside the current values;
  `withdraw_condition_edit` drops it. Design: `design/PROPOSALS.md`
- **Scope collision** (#366)—`takeoff_summary.shared_floor_sf` is the floor
  claimed by more than one shape across the takeoff (Σ areas − union, once per
  cell), the number that has to read zero before a total means anything;
  `scope_duplicates` names every pair on different conditions with the shared
  SF, both sides' review state and a `view_sheet` look region (same-condition
  double traces as their own list); `scope_merge` resolves one pair with the
  winner stated—the loser trimmed to its remainder by an exact boolean
  difference or deleted when near-total, one undo step, never a shape the
  estimator affirmed. Design: `design/SCOPE_COLLISION.md`
- **Condition twins**—`duplicate_condition` (the same finish measured
  somewhere else with its own preparation underneath: the twin arrives carrying
  the original's materials and keeps *following* them, so a coverage-rate fix on
  the original reaches every twin that hasn't touched that row) and
  `split_condition` (cut a twin loose—following rows freeze at their current
  values and the original stops reaching it). One finish in two areas is neither
  one condition nor two; both are reversible with `undo_last`
- **Read the sheet**—`read_sheet_text`, `find_text`, `view_sheet` (render a
  sheet or crop to PNG with an optional calibrated measuring grid and
  committed-shapes overlay—the agent's eyes and its self-check)
- **Annotate**—`annotate` (cloud, highlight, text, callout, arrow—plank/seam
  direction—keynote bubble, and dimension: two endpoints, drawn
  as a dimension line labeled with the measured length at the sheet's scale,
  refused on an unscaled sheet), `list_annotations`,
  `link_annotation` (notes *about* the work, never measurements of it;
  attaching one to a finish tag is what makes it part of that scope rather
  than a floating remark—it then wears the condition's color on the canvas
  and in the marked set)
- **Sign**—`mark_verdict`, `delete_verdict` (the agent half of the approval
  family: the graphite AGENT diamond, the agent's pencil-signature on work it
  checked—anchored on a committed shape or dropped at a sheet point, listed
  in `list_annotations`' `verdicts[]`. The estimator's APPROVED ring is the
  other half and stays human-only: these tools take no actor input, so no
  agent path can mint or lift the human's ink. A verdict touches no quantity)
- **Ask**—`create_rfi`, `list_rfis`, `resolve_rfi`, `delete_rfi` (the canvas's
  RFI register, reachable by an agent: when the drawings are the problem—a
  schedule row the plan never draws, a room the schedule has no row for—raise
  it as a numbered question instead of a sentence in a reply. Same store, same
  numbering, same markup link as the panel; everything the agent raises is
  `origin {actor: "agent", reviewed: false}`—pending until the estimator
  accepts it in the register, because an RFI goes to the architect and nothing
  sends without a human. A delete is a tombstone: the number is never reissued
  and the marked set keeps the gap. All four are journaled for `undo_last`)
- **Report**—`takeoff_summary` (quantities only—materials stripped),
  `export_takeoff` (the raw `opentakeoff.takeoff_canvas.v1` canvas payload—materials
  as config rows, importable by the app), `export_report` (the
  computed `opentakeoff.report.v1` Report document—waste-adjusted nets, the
  materials buy list as order quantities, per-sheet subtotals, scale
  provenance; the contract for pricing consumers), `export_marked_pdf` (**the
  marked-up planset**—the plan sheets vector-copied with shapes, hatches,
  quantity chips, and annotations burned in, plus a legend cover; the
  deliverable a human reviews, with machine-traced work disclosed as pending
  review on the document itself)

  All three write wherever you point them—`path` is not confined to a working
  directory, because the marked set belongs in the job folder. They will not
  overwrite a file they didn't write, though: a previous export of ours is
  replaced silently (the ordinary re-export loop), and anything else is refused
  until you pass `overwrite: true`. Data-loss protection, not a sandbox—see
  [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md).

The full reference—including the coordinate contract (image px at render
scale 2.0, origin top-left) and the scale-gate rules—is in
[`mcp/README.md`](../mcp/README.md), which is the list to trust: this page is
prose and `mcp/src/tools.ts` is the source of truth for what actually
registers.

Two rules carry over from the app unchanged:

- **The scale gate.** No quantity leaves the server without a scale on that
  sheet—and a scale the agent sets is **unconfirmed until a human confirms
  it in the canvas** (`confirmed: false` on the reply,
  `scale_unconfirmed` on the summary, `scale_confirmed` on the
  export/report). A detected scale note is a suggestion the agent must adopt
  explicitly (`set_scale { use_detected: true }`); measuring tools refuse
  with the exact hint (`Set the scale for <sheet> first—use set_scale
  (detected: 1/4" = 1'-0").`), and a bare `one_click` returns px-only numbers
  with a warning rather than fabricating square feet.
- **Provenance.** Every shape committed by `one_click`/`detect_rooms` carries
  the same `origin` receipt the canvas mints: method, normalized seed,
  hatch-filter flag—and `raster_traced` when the boundary came from scan
  pixels rather than vector linework, so a pixel-bounded trace is
  distinguishable from a vector-snapped one in the record. The sealed engine's
  own account of each trace rides too, stamped centrally at the commit so no
  flood path can ship without it: `confidence` (0–1, with
  `confidence_factors` naming every deduction) scores the trace from the
  engine's internal signals—`gap_sealed_px` when part of the boundary is a
  synthetic seal across a real opening, `door_wedges`/`ring_interiors` for
  annexed door swings and closed-ring interiors, `min_pass_px`/
  `min_pass_delta` when the feet-true minimum-passage rule changed the
  answer, `gap_bridged_px` for the pinhole rescue. Read the score as a review
  prioritizer, never a verification: 1.0 means every signal the engine can
  see came back clean, not that the trace is right, and a low-confidence
  trace is a `view_sheet {overlay: true}` audit prompt, not a fact. The same
  fields appear on the tool replies, so an agent can triage before it
  commits.

And one capability deliberately does **not** carry over: **stitching**. The
canvas can join sheets split at a match line into one composite surface, but
there is no agent verb for it—aligning the match line means clicking the
same drawn wall junction on both halves, a human-judgment act whose failure
mode (a subtly sloppy join) silently skews every quantity that crosses the
seam. Same doctrine as the scale gate, taken one step further: here the agent
doesn't even propose. A human stitches and aligns in the canvas; an agent
works the member sheets individually and leaves seam-crossing rooms to the
person at the screen. See the Limits section of
[`mcp/README.md`](../mcp/README.md) for the round-trip caveat that follows.

## An example session

An agent asked to *"take off the carpet on this floor plan"*—tool calls
verbatim, replies abridged:

```
▸ load_plan  { "path": "/plans/sample-plan.pdf" }
  { "file": "sample-plan.pdf", "page_count": 1,
    "sheets": [{ "sheet": "sample-plan.pdf", "width_px": 2448, "height_px": 1584,
                 "width_pt": 1224, "height_pt": 792,
                 "sheet_number": "A-101", "detected_scale": "1/4\" = 1'-0\"" }] }

▸ read_sheet_text  { "sheet": "sample-plan.pdf",
                     "region": { "x0": 1468, "y0": 871, "x1": 2448, "y1": 1584 } }
  { "items": [ { "str": "A-101", "x": 1970, "y": 1284 },
               { "str": "SCALE: 1/4\" = 1'-0\"", "x": 1730, "y": 1348 } ],
    "text": "A-101 SCALE: 1/4\" = 1'-0\"" }

    The title block confirms the detected scale — adopt it explicitly:

▸ set_scale  { "sheet": "sample-plan.pdf", "use_detected": true }
  { "sheet": "sample-plan.pdf", "upp": 0.02778, "label": "1/4\" = 1'-0\"", "source": "detected" }

    Room labels from the page text double as click targets (same px space):

▸ one_click  { "sheet": "sample-plan.pdf", "x": 600, "y": 1084, "condition": "CPT-1" }
  { "status": "ok", "area_sf": 437.98, "perimeter_lf": 86.61, "nverts": 4, "shape_id": "shp-…" }

▸ one_click  { "sheet": "sample-plan.pdf", "x": 1640, "y": 1084, "condition": "CPT-1" }
▸ one_click  { "sheet": "sample-plan.pdf", "x": 600,  "y": 464,  "condition": "CPT-1" }
▸ one_click  { "sheet": "sample-plan.pdf", "x": 1600, "y": 464,  "condition": "CPT-1" }
  … three more rooms, ~438 SF each …

    Two of those rooms are actually tile — reassign, then let the derivations
    do the work that follows from the rooms instead of measuring it again:

▸ edit_shape  { "shape_id": "shp-…", "condition": "PT-1" }     … and one more

▸ derive_transitions  { "condition_a": "CPT-1", "condition_b": "PT-1", "condition": "T-1" }
  { "between": ["CPT-1", "PT-1"], "committed": 2, "total_lf": 53.88,
    "runs": [{ "length_lf": 26.94, "gap_in": 0.3, "at": [725, 784], … },
             { "length_lf": 26.94, "gap_in": 0.3, "at": [1715, 784], … }],
    "withheld": [], "withheld_lf": 0 }

    Both runs are butt joints (gap under an inch — one open space). Had the
    rooms been a partition apart, they would have come back in `withheld`
    instead: adjacency across a wall is a threshold in a doorway this cannot
    locate, so it is handed back as a question with a point to look at.

▸ takeoff_summary  {}
  { "conditions": [{ "finish_tag": "CPT-1", "shape_count": 2, … },
                   { "finish_tag": "PT-1",  "shape_count": 2, … },
                   { "finish_tag": "T-1",   "shape_count": 2, "lf": 53.88, … }],
    "totals": { … } }

    Look before trusting any of it, then finish with the deliverable:

▸ view_sheet  { "sheet": "sample-plan.pdf", "overlay": true,
                "region": { "x0": 500, "y0": 600, "x1": 1900, "y1": 1000 } }
  … PNG: committed shapes burned in, unreviewed machine work dashed …

▸ export_marked_pdf  {}
  { "path": "/plans/sample-plan - marked set.pdf", "sheets": 1, … }

▸ export_report  { "path": "/plans/sample-report.json" }
  { "schema": "opentakeoff.report.v1", "conditions": [...], … }
```

A click that misses is a readable answer, not a stack trace—outside the
building: `That space isn't enclosed on the plan linework—the fill spilled
through a gap or opening.`; in dense hatching or a text block: `Landed in
dense linework (hatching or text).`

## Where this sits

- The **MCP server** is the agent-integration surface: real tools, real
  quantities, stdio.
- The **[AI sandbox](../server/README.md)** (`server/`) is the other socket—a
  FastAPI adapter interface for plugging your own local *vision model* under
  the canvas's suggestion endpoints.
- Scanned (raster-only) sheets **are** supported (#154): where vectors cannot
  bound a room, `one_click` and `detect_rooms` fall back automatically to
  flooding the sheet's rendered pixels with the same raster engine the canvas
  uses, disclosed as `raster_traced` on the reply and on the shape's origin.
  Vector wins wherever it works—a raster ring's corners are unsnapped,
  because a scan has no true endpoints to snap to.

## Calibration and review correctness (0.9.72)

`set_scale` recomputes existing dimensional quantities from geometry, including holes and cutout restore snapshots. Changing an existing calibration records one `undo_last` step that restores the scale, its confirmation/source, and the prior quantities together. Initial calibration of an unmeasured sheet adds no undo step. Counts retain their stored values. A sheet containing human-reviewed dimensional measurements refuses recalibration over MCP, consistent with the existing reviewed-shape edit rules; recalibrate it in the canvas and import the updated takeoff into a fresh session.

`import_takeoff` refuses new dimensional shapes when their source calibration differs from the session's calibration, or is missing while the session has one. The error names the sheet and scales; no session state changes. Align calibrations and re-export, or load a fresh session to adopt the export's calibration. Counts and duplicate IDs are exempt. An existing calibration is preserved even in an untraced session.

New agent measurements, including `measure_polygon` and `measure_line`, explicitly carry `origin.reviewed: false`. Legacy agent records without the flag are normalized on import and browser reload. Explicit prior human approval is preserved. No new review gate is introduced.

## Geometry workflow

[Geometry from source to review](GEOMETRY_WORKFLOW.md) gives the measurement order and verification checks for a real finish takeoff. Discover tools before invoking them so the client validates the declared output contracts.

## Review cleanup and current tool inventory

The [generated tool index](MCP_TOOL_INDEX.md) gives each tool's stage and required
arguments directly from the running server's schemas. The default surface has
<!--tool-count-->53<!--/tool-count--> tools; gated tools and the staged opener are listed separately.

Use `list_annotations` → `edit_annotation {annotation_id, text}` to shorten or clear
a note. One `undo_last` restores the text. Geometry, dimension length, links and
human review are unchanged. RFI-linked notes refuse; inspect their question in
the browser register. Verdicts are separate records, not editable annotations.

`scope_duplicates` ignores machine-precision edge residue, but preserves real
small overlaps with an explanation when SF rounds to zero. A material coverage
row is not another finish polygon. For a physical opening, clip an explicit
`measure_line` or `measure_surface` run with `cut_out`; a derived base with numeric
opening allowances refuses clipping because those openings have no locations.

## Wiki resources

Read `takeoff://wiki` for the [knowledge index](wiki/README.md), then the one
`takeoff://wiki/{page}` resource the current task needs. The index and eight
pages are readable before any plan is loaded, in flat or staged mode. They
contain public documentation packaged with the MCP version, not project data.
No additional measurement tool or approval authority is introduced.

The bundle is generated from the repository wiki and tool index; CI checks
content, source hashes, version and links. Wiki-to-wiki links stay within MCP
resources. Code/reference links browse repository `main`, which may be newer
than an installed package. This distinction is stated in each resource reply.

The draft Takeoff Protocol is also available as static resources. Read
`takeoff://protocol` for the compact index, then the allowlisted schemas under
`takeoff://protocol/{path}`. This route is available before plan load and in
staged mode. It is contract/discovery material and introduces no validator tool
or writer migration. Resource URIs are transport addresses separate from the
unchanged schema `$id` identifiers; those IDs support offline `$ref` resolution
and do not promise hosted files. Read `takeoff://wiki/protocol` for scope,
projection omissions, and validation limits.

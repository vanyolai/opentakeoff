# OpenTakeoff knowledge index

Read the page that answers the current question. Agents can read this index at
`takeoff://wiki` and individual pages at `takeoff://wiki/{page}` without loading
a plan. These are documentation resources, not additional measurement tools.

| Question | Page | MCP resource |
|---|---|---|
| What works, what is draft, and what is unsupported? | [Capability status](status.md) | `takeoff://wiki/status` |
| How do the browser, MCP and shared engine fit together? | [Architecture](architecture.md) | `takeoff://wiki/architecture` |
| What does a saved takeoff mean? | [Protocol](protocol.md) | `takeoff://wiki/protocol` |
| How do I measure, stitch, review and hand off work? | [Workflows](workflows.md) | `takeoff://wiki/workflows` |
| Which tool should I call, and in which coordinate frame? | [MCP routing](mcp.md) | `takeoff://wiki/mcp` |
| What do floor SF, wall SF, base LF and review mean? | [Domain knowledge](domain.md) | `takeoff://wiki/domain` |
| How do I change this repository and verify a PR? | [Repository guide](repo-guide.md) | `takeoff://wiki/repo-guide` |
| What tools and required inputs does the runtime expose? | [Generated tool index](../MCP_TOOL_INDEX.md) | `takeoff://wiki/tool-index` |

For detailed canvas instructions, use the [human guide](../USER_GUIDE.md).
For a full takeoff session, use the [agent guide](../AGENT_GUIDE.md).
The wiki routes to their detailed procedures rather than copying every control
and schema into every page.

Proposed priorities are tracked separately in the [roadmap](../ROADMAP.md). They
are acceptance targets, not shipped capability; use [capability status](status.md)
for what is available today.

The MCP build embeds these pages. CI checks the embedded copy, tool inventory,
schema references and documentation links against their sources. Reading a
resource does not mutate a session, set scale, review work or grant approval.

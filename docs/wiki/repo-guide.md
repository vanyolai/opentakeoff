# Working on the repository

OpenTakeoff is a **client-only React app**: a PDF construction-takeoff canvas for flooring (useful for any trade). No backend, no database, no auth—everything runs and persists in the browser. Apache-2.0. (For the one-page project pitch and vision, see [`AGENT_BRIEF.md`](../../AGENT_BRIEF.md); for capability → code mapping, see [`FEATURES.md`](../../FEATURES.md).)

## Run / build / check

```bash
cd web
nvm use          # web/.nvmrc matches the root .nvmrc used by CI
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173 — hot reload
npm test         # node:test over the pure geometry + totals math (test/*.test.ts)
npm run build    # → web/dist/ (static output; this is what Netlify deploys)
npm run check    # web typecheck + lint + test + benchmark + build
```

## Shipping — the required steps, every change

`main` is protected on GitHub by a ruleset (PR-only, one approving review,
green `web` check—the repo owner has a standing bypass
as the solo maintainer). **Merging to `main` deploys to production**
(<https://opentakeoff.kentucky-ai.com>)—Netlify's own git integration builds
the merge commit and publishes it. `netlify.toml` holds the whole recipe
(`base = "web"`, `command = npm run build`, `publish = "dist"`), so the deploy
runs a fresh build from the merged source; nothing is uploaded from CI.

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` used to do this by publishing `web/dist` with
`--no-build`, and it was **deleted on 2026-07-13 in `e701f1a`** ("deploys here
are manual CLI; it fails on every push without the fork's secrets"). Current checks and release automation live in
[the workflow directory](../../.github/workflows); `publish-mcp.yml` fires on
an `mcp-v*` tag. The old line here said "Netlify never builds anything
itself", which is now exactly backwards—Netlify is the only thing that
builds production. **Merge = deploy either way: that part has never changed.**

> **This is the canonical `Kentucky-ai/opentakeoff` repo—production is

So:

1. **Branch first**—never commit on `main`: `git checkout -b <topic>`.
2. **`npm run check` before pushing** (in `web/`). It covers the independent web
   job on Node 24; a green web check does not replace the MCP, protocol, docs,
   capture or optional-server jobs.
3. **Include review evidence in every PR**: screenshots or a short video for
   visible changes; measured expected-versus-observed stats and reproducible
   commands for engine/tool changes. Link the actual checks or evidence. This
   repository is also the maintainer's public portfolio: keep claims verifiable
   and private project data out of public artifacts.
4. **Open a PR** and wait for the `web` check to pass. Don't merge red or
   pending.
5. **Squash-merge with branch delete**
   (`gh pr merge <n> --squash --delete-branch`), then
   `git checkout main && git pull --ff-only` and delete the local branch
   (`git branch -D <topic>`—squash merges need `-D`).
6. **Remember a merge is a deploy.** Don't merge work you haven't verified in
   the running app.

The tests cover the pure math (`web/test/geometry.test.ts`, `web/test/totals.test.ts`); the canvas itself is verified by hand—**Vite does not flag undefined identifiers in JSX**, so grep for your new identifiers after editing and load the app once before you call it done. The bundled sample plan (`web/public/demo/`, wired to the "Load sample plan" button) is the fastest end-to-end check: load it, press `A`, trace a room, open Report.

## Where things live

| Concern | Path |
|---|---|
| **The canvas—90% of the app** | `web/src/pages/TakeoffCanvas.jsx` (one large, deliberately monolithic component) |
| Geometry: vector extraction, One-Click flood fill, vertex snap | `web/src/lib/oneclick.ts` |
| Sheet/page helpers, scale detection | `web/src/lib/sheets.ts` |
| Totals and materials math (waste, SY, coverage → order qty) | `web/src/lib/totals.js` |
| Persistence (IndexedDB + localStorage) | `web/src/lib/store.js` |
| PDF/image/zip ingest | `web/src/lib/ingest.js` |
| Icon set | `web/src/brand/icons.jsx` |
| Design tokens (colors, spacing—the source of truth) | `web/src/styles/tokens.css` |
| Sheet gallery / report UI | `web/src/components/` |
| Pure-math tests (node:test) | `web/test/` |
| **Optional AI backend** (pluggable adapter: scale/room/finish suggestions) | `server/`—`app.py` + `adapters/base.py` (interface) + `adapters/heuristic.py` (default, no model) |

## How the canvas works (the mental model)

- Each open sheet renders into a `<canvas>` bitmap; **all takeoff geometry is an SVG overlay** on top; pan/zoom is a single CSS transform on the stage div, written imperatively (`tfRef` → `style.transform`) to avoid React re-renders per frame.
- Coordinates: pointer events (client px) → `toImage()` → **stage px**; committed shapes store **normalized [0..1] vertices per sheet** (`verts_norm`), so quantities survive re-renders and zoom.
- Cursor-following UI (crosshair hairlines, readout chip, rubber band) updates through **direct DOM writes in `moveCrosshair`**—never React state per mousemove. Keep it that way.
- Angle snapping: `angleSnap()` locks in-progress segments to the 45° family; endpoint snap (`nearestSnap` over a spatial hash of PDF vector endpoints) takes priority. The committed click reuses the same locked point (`angleRef`).
- Past ~1.15× zoom, a **detail-view canvas** re-renders the visible region from PDF vectors at the current zoom (crispness); the base bitmap stays as first paint.
- pdf.js rendering schedules work on `requestAnimationFrame`—a fully hidden/occluded window will pause mid-render by design; it resumes when visible.

## Conventions

- **SVG presentation attributes take literal colors** (CSS vars don't resolve there): cobalt `#1f3fc7`, danger `#b03a26`, positive `#1f6b4a`—centralized in `web/src/lib/ui.js` (`SVG`, with HUD-dark counterparts through `svgAccent(isDark)`). DOM/HTML chrome may use `var(--…)` from `tokens.css`.
- Condition palettes (`PALETTE` and `HATCH_IDS` in `web/src/lib/takeoffConstants.ts`, which both the canvas and `mcp/src/session.ts` import, and the seeded condition colors in `FLOORING_DEFAULTS` in `web/src/lib/canvasConstants.js`) are **user data**—don't re-theme them. The same module owns the takeoff and report schema ids, `RENDER_SCALE` and the snap constants; parity tests in `web/test`, `mcp/test` and `protocol/test` fail if a copy reappears.
- Waste applies only in the report (order quantities), never to live measured numbers.
- Keyboard shortcuts are single letters registered on `window` (see `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` §15); toolbar menus pause them through `menuDepthRef`.
- Brand voice: **precision instrument** (2026-08 overhaul). Light theme = "ice": bright white surfaces on a cool field, cool-slate neutrals, cobalt the one saturated thing. Dark theme = "HUD": true-black cockpit, electric blue `#3f8cff`, phosphor `--glow` on exactly five elements (active tool face, status verb, hero quantity, primary CTA, calibration dot). Square corners; the single sanctioned radius is `--r-1` on floating chrome. Mono tabular numerals on every readout. Drafting-table language stays. No vendor mimicry.
- Layout/spacing/type come from the token scales in `tokens.css` (`--sp-*`, `--fs-*`, `--ctl-*`); zIndex comes from the `Z` ladder in `web/src/lib/ui.js`. No new magic numbers.

## Docs to keep in sync when you change behavior

The draft Takeoff Protocol lives in [`protocol/`](../../protocol/README.md). When
changing persisted fields, consult its [inventory](../../protocol/INVENTORY.md) and
[compatibility report](../../protocol/ACADEMY_COMPATIBILITY.md). Run
`npm run check --prefix protocol` after installing web, MCP, and protocol
dependencies. Refresh schema references with
`node protocol/scripts/check-docs.mjs --write`. The draft does not authorize
changing writer formats or adopting a migration.

1. `README.md` (Features + "What's in the box")
2. `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` (shortcuts + the relevant section)
3. `CHANGELOG.md`

Touching the **MCP server** also requires checking its runtime guidance and
generated references:

4. `mcp/src/tools.ts`—the tool's own `description` is part of its integration.
   An MCP client reads it at runtime. Initialize instructions and packaged wiki
   resources are also agent-facing surfaces, so keep them consistent with the
   runtime behavior.
5. `mcp/server.ts`—the `instructions` block sent at `initialize`. This is the
   decision tree every client receives before its first call. A new *verb* does
   not belong here; a new *step in the standard finish* does. Packaged wiki
   resources are another deliberate agent-facing surface; update their source
   pages and run the wiki/resource checks when their guidance changes.
6. `mcp/README.md` (the tool table) and `docs/MCP.md` (the reach-for-it ordering,
   the example session, and the tool count in its opening line). A new tool also
   needs a row in `mcp/src/staging.ts`'s `TOOL_STAGES`—the four lists must
   partition the tool set exactly, and a test fails CI if one doesn't.
   `npm run check:tool-count --prefix mcp` checks default, gated and setup counts across the current entry points,
   reference-table coverage, and [`docs/MCP_TOOL_INDEX.md`](../../docs/MCP_TOOL_INDEX.md)
   against runtime schemas. Add `-- --write` to regenerate counts and the index. If the
   change alters *doctrine* rather than adding a verb—what withholds, what
   refuses, what has no agent verb—it belongs in `docs/AGENT_GUIDE.md` too,
   and the tool count appears there and in `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` §14.
7. **Version fields must agree.** The MCP source version is
   in `mcp/package.json`; its lockfile has two matching fields, while
   `mcp/server.json` and `web/public/.well-known/mcp.json` each have two. The
   version checker checks all seven MCP fields. Separately, it checks the web
   package version against the two root-version fields in its lockfile.
   Check current `origin/main` and existing tags before
   reserving a number. The web package has its own version; it is not the MCP
   release number.
8. `npm run check:tool-count --prefix mcp` runs version agreement before checking
   counts and the schema-backed inventory. With `-- --write`, it refuses version
   mismatches before changing generated documents; update release metadata
   explicitly, then regenerate. Run `npm run check:versions --prefix mcp` for the
   version check alone. Wiki content has its own generator:
   `npm run check:wiki --prefix mcp -- --write`. Review generated diffs and run
   both checks without `--write` afterward.

Architecture rather than behavior—what MCP is versus what the `/ai` sandbox
is, and why the server imports the web engine in-process—lives at the end of
[`docs/MCP.md`](../../docs/MCP.md) ("Where this sits") and in
[`server/README.md`](../../server/README.md).

## The doc set, and who each one is for

Four documents carry the product, and they're deliberately split by audience—don't
answer an estimator's question in the agent manual or vice versa:

| Document | Audience | What belongs in it |
|---|---|---|
| [`README.md`](../../README.md) | everyone, ~60 seconds | what this is, the three doors, what's in the box |
| [`docs/USER_GUIDE.md`](../../docs/USER_GUIDE.md) | the estimator at the canvas | every shipped UI behavior, the working order on a real bid, the glossary |
| [`docs/AGENT_GUIDE.md`](../../docs/AGENT_GUIDE.md) | an agent driving the engine | the operating model, the standard finish, withheld doctrine, staging, refusal→next-move |
| [`mcp/README.md`](../../mcp/README.md) | an agent's integrator | tool-by-tool reference, resources, coordinate contract, limits |

All of them follow one house style—the Apple Style Guide, with the rules that
actually come up written out in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#docs-house-style).
Interface text quoted in a doc is copied from the code verbatim, so changing a
message means changing it in both places.

[`AGENT_BRIEF.md`](../../AGENT_BRIEF.md) is the one-page orientation that routes to
all four. A behavior change usually touches two of them; a new MCP tool touches
three plus this file's sync list above.

# Package boundaries: the dependency map and the first extraction

Phase 4 of the roadmap begins with a map, not a move. This page records what the browser app,
the MCP server and the protocol tooling actually share today, measured from the build and the
import graph on `main` at `2797ea0`, names one concrete coupling problem, and proposes one small
extraction with its contract stated up front. No file moves in this change.

## How the map was measured

- `esbuild server.ts --bundle --platform=node --format=esm --packages=external --analyze` on
  `mcp/server.ts`: the exact set of `web/src/lib` files that ship in `dist/server-core.js`.
- Every `import` line in `mcp/src/*.ts`, `mcp/test/*.ts`, `protocol/src/*.mjs`,
  `protocol/scripts/*.mjs`, `protocol/test/*.mjs` that resolves across a package boundary.
- Each shared module read for `document`, `window`, `indexedDB`, `localStorage`, React and
  canvas use.

## The layers, as built

| Layer | Where | Runtime | Who imports it |
|---|---|---|---|
| Browser UI | `web/src/pages`, `web/src/components` | browser only (React, DOM) | nobody outside `web/` |
| Engine libraries | `web/src/lib/*.{js,ts}` | browser and Node; no file imports React | the UI, the MCP server, the protocol tests, the web bench |
| MCP server | `mcp/server.ts`, `mcp/src/*.ts` | Node 20+ over stdio | `bin/server.js`, the MCPB bundle, the tests |
| Packaged resources | `mcp/src/wiki.generated.ts`, `mcp/src/protocol.generated.ts` | embedded in the bundle | `mcp/src/resources.ts` |
| Protocol tooling | `protocol/src`, `protocol/scripts`, `protocol/v1`, `protocol/legacy` | Node 24 dev-only, private package | `protocol/test` only; nothing at runtime |
| Generators and guards | `mcp/scripts/check-*.mjs`, `scripts/check-version-consistency.mjs`, `protocol/scripts/check-*.mjs` | CI and `npm run build` | the build and CI |

**Direction is one-way.** `web/` imports nothing from `mcp/` or `protocol/` (twelve comment
mentions, zero imports). `mcp/src` reaches into `web/src/lib` through 30 import lines naming 30 engine modules, all by relative
path (`../../web/src/lib/…`), enabled by `mcp/tsconfig.json` (`allowJs`, `checkJs: false`, `lib`
without DOM). `protocol/` runtime code imports only `node:*`, `ajv` and itself; its tests import
`mcp/src/session.ts` and about twelve `web/src/lib` modules, which is why the protocol CI job
installs web and mcp first.

## What the MCP bundle actually carries

38 engine files ship inside `dist/server-core.js` (846.8 kB total bundle). The largest:
`oneclick.ts` 88.4 kB, `sheetgraph.ts` 49.3 kB, `markedset.js` 36.8 kB, `symbolsweep.ts`
26.1 kB, `dxf.ts` 13.6 kB, `rollgoods.js` 11.9 kB, `totals.js` 11.1 kB, `svgpath.js` 10.7 kB,
`importTakeoff.js` 7.4 kB, `transitions.ts` 7.2 kB, `scopeCollision.js` 7.0 kB. Twenty-three are
imported directly (all but one through `mcp/src/session.ts`); fifteen ride in transitively.
Seven statically imported files tree-shake to nothing.

Everything shared is DOM-free at the functions the server calls, with three seams:

- `web/src/lib/totals.js` exports `downloadText()` (`document.createElement("a")`) beside the
  pure quantity functions; the server never calls it, but it ships.
- `web/src/lib/markedset.js` has a `document.createElement("canvas")` dark/raster branch and a
  `downloadBytes()`; `mcp/src/marked.ts` uses only the light vector path and says so.
- `web/src/lib/importTakeoff.js` imports `web/src/lib/store.js` (IndexedDB) for one string,
  `ANN_SCHEMA`; esbuild tree-shakes the module to 51 bytes, but an IndexedDB module is in the
  graph for a constant.

`mcp/tsconfig.json` is the de facto DOM-freeness gate for the shared `.ts` files; the shared
`.js` files (`totals.js`, `markedset.js`, `importTakeoff.js`, `approvals.js`, `cutout.js`,
`scopeCollision.js`, `rollTakeoff.js`, `rfi.js`, `geometry.js`, `shapeMetrics.js`) have no gate
(`checkJs: false`).

**Dependencies are declared twice.** The engine modules' packages are re-declared in
`mcp/package.json` because the bundle is built with `--packages=external`: `pdfjs-dist`
(`sheets.ts` and `mcp/src/pdf.ts`), `pdf-lib` (`markedset.js` lazily, `safewrite.ts`), `jsts`
(`scopeCollision.js`), `@turf/*` (`cutout.js`). Ranges drift: `@turf/*` is `^7.3.5` in
`web/package.json` and `^7.4.0` in `mcp/package.json`. `fflate` is web-only.

## What is shared by import, and what is copied by hand

Shared, single implementation, consumed by import: import/merge rules (`importTakeoff.js`),
marked set (`markedset.js`), report JSON (`totals.js`), approvals, rules, cutouts, scope
collisions, roll goods, RFIs, condition twins, transitions, shape metrics, geometry, DXF,
One-Click, raster masks, room detection, symbol sweep, layers, sheet graph, confidence, scale
detection. The coordinate frame is one constant, `RENDER_SCALE` in `web/src/lib/sheets.ts`,
imported by five MCP files and pinned by `mcp/test/parity.test.ts`.

Copied by hand, with no test that the copies agree:

| Value | Copy 1 | Copy 2 | Copy 3 | Drift on record |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| condition palette (10 colors) | `web/src/components/hatches.jsx:48` `PALETTE` | `mcp/src/session.ts:75` | partial, reordered: `web/src/lib/scheduleParse.ts:147` | none yet; `session.ts:70` says "copied from the canvas" |
| hatch id vocabulary (31 ids) | `hatches.jsx:12` `HATCHES` | `session.ts:78` `HATCH_IDS` | | **historical**: `session.ts:76` records a `fleur` entry that drifted in and was dropped in 2026-07; the canvas later added a real `fleur` hatch (#243), and the two lists were checked equal (31 = 31, same order) before this extraction |
| hatch rotation formula | `web/src/pages/TakeoffCanvas.jsx:5904` | `session.ts:1344` and `:4078` | | |
| condition record minted | `web/src/pages/TakeoffCanvas.jsx:5893` `mintCondition` (has `created_at`) | `session.ts:1334` `conditionFor`, commented "field-identical" | | **yes**: MCP omits `created_at` |
| snap grid and tolerance | `canvasConstants.js:54` `SNAP_CELL = 24` | `oneclick.ts:3739` `SNAP_CELL_PX = 24`, `SNAP_TOL_PX = 7` | `session.ts:73` `SNAP_CELL`, `SNAP_TOL` | |
| takeoff schema id | `store.js:54` `ANN_SCHEMA` | `session.ts:90` | `protocol/src/validation.mjs:7` and `protocol/legacy/takeoff-canvas.v1.schema.json:14` | the only identity family with no checker at all |
| report schema id | `totals.js:498` | `mcp/src/outputs.ts:700` | `mcp/src/safewrite.ts:44` (regex) | |
| `mintUuid` / `nowIso` | `web/src/lib/provenance.js:10` (header: "so mcp/ can exercise it directly") | `session.ts:79` re-declared "mirrors provenance.js" | | MCP never imports the module it mirrors |
| `proposed_condition_edits` rows | `web/src/lib/proposals.js:104` | `session.ts:2038` | | web coerces numbers, MCP does not |
| export payload envelope | `web/src/pages/TakeoffCanvas.jsx:2281` `buildPayload` | `session.ts:4762` `exportPayload` | | canvas writes 8 extra keys (`palette`, `rules`, `stitches`, `layer_overrides`, `provenance_counters`, …); MCP always writes `units` |
| report envelope shape | `totals.js` writer | `mcp/src/outputs.ts:699` zod mirror ("the authority is the web export") | | |
| One-Click gate strings | `web/src/lib/gate.js` | `mcp/src/gate.ts` | | different runtimes, tested separately |

Identity and count fields have guards: `scripts/check-version-consistency.mjs` (seven MCP
version fields, three web fields), `mcp/scripts/check-tool-count.mjs` (22 markers in ten docs
plus a grep for unmarked counts), `check-wiki.mjs` and `check-protocol-resources.mjs` (generated
bundles with source digests). The schema ids have none. Two hand-maintained tables duplicate
generated ones without a check on their content: the tool table in `mcp/README.md` (names are
compared to `docs/MCP_TOOL_INDEX.md`, descriptions are not) and the "Where things live" table in
`docs/wiki/repo-guide.md`, which still says the default conditions are mirrored in
`mcp/src/session.ts`; they are not, and that sentence ships in the packaged wiki.

## The coupling problem this phase picks

Hand-mirrored constants across three packages with no cross-check. It is the only class of
duplication here with a drift already on record (the `fleur` hatch id), it includes the one
identity family nothing guards (the takeoff schema id in four places), and it is the reason
`importTakeoff.js` drags an IndexedDB module into a Node bundle. It is also the smallest thing
in the map: seven frozen values, no functions, no dependencies, no runtime behavior.

The reason the copies exist is stated in the code: `PALETTE` lives in `hatches.jsx`, which
imports React, so nothing outside the browser can import it
(`web/src/lib/canvasUtil.js:5`: "the seeder pulls PALETTE from components/hatches.jsx, which
imports React — don't import this module outside the web app (mcp/ keeps its own mirrored
copies)").

Not chosen, and why: the geometry core (`sheets.ts`, `geometry.js`, `totals.js`, `cutout.js`,
…) is already consumed by import, carries the heavy dependencies; extracting it removes no duplication and only changes the
form of the coupling. The document read/write layer (export payload,
`proposals.js`, `provenance.js`) holds the most consequential drift, two writers of one schema,
but `buildPayload` is welded to canvas component state (`palette`, `conditionColumns`,
`layerOverrides`, `provCounters`); it becomes cheaper after the constants move, so it is the
second increment, not the first.

## The extraction: `web/src/lib/takeoffConstants.ts`

**Status: shipped in 0.9.85** (the PR after this map). The section below is the contract as
proposed; what landed matches it, with two deliberate differences: the protocol package keeps its
runtime import-free and pins the schema id in a test instead of importing the module, and
`scheduleParse.ts`'s `FALLBACK_PALETTE` was left alone because it is a different, shorter list
(it contains `#475569`, which the condition palette does not), not a copy.


One DOM-free engine module that owns the mirrored values, imported by both surfaces and by the
protocol tests. Not a new npm package: there is no consumer outside this repository, the MCP
bundle already inlines engine modules, and a second publish pipeline would add a version to
keep in agreement for no reader.

**Public API** (named, frozen, values only):

```ts
export const TAKEOFF_SCHEMA = "opentakeoff.takeoff_canvas.v1";
export const REPORT_SCHEMA  = "opentakeoff.report.v1";
export const RENDER_SCALE   = 2.0;                 // re-exported by sheets.ts, which keeps its import sites
export const PALETTE: readonly string[];           // the ten condition colors, user data, never re-themed
export const HATCH_IDS: readonly string[];         // the 31 hatch ids in HATCHES order
export const SNAP_CELL = 24;
export const SNAP_TOL  = 7;
export function nextHatchId(conditionCount: number): string;   // the rotation both sides implement today
```

`hatches.jsx` keeps `HATCHES` (ids plus labels plus the SVG patterns, browser-only) and asserts
in a test that its ids equal `HATCH_IDS`. `store.js`, `totals.js`, `mcp/src/session.ts`,
`mcp/src/outputs.ts`, `mcp/src/safewrite.ts`, `canvasConstants.js`, `oneclick.ts` and
`scheduleParse.ts` import instead of re-declaring. `protocol/src/validation.mjs` imports the
schema id the way its tests already import web modules, and a protocol test asserts the JSON
schema's `const` equals it.

**Supported runtimes:** any ES2022 module consumer; no imports at all, so it runs in the
browser build, in the Node bundle and under `node --test` unchanged.

**Ownership:** the engine, `web/src/lib`, under the web `tsconfig`; the repository guide's
"user data, never re-theme" rule for the palette moves onto the module's header.

**Compatibility and versioning:** no persisted format changes and no value changes; every
constant keeps today's literal. `mcp/src/session.ts` changes only in where the values come from,
so the published MCP bytes change and the next `mcp-v*` tag carries it; the web app needs no
release. The `conditionFor` `created_at` omission is a behavior difference and is **not** folded
in silently: the implementation either adds `created_at` with a test and a changelog line, or
records the divergence in the doc; it does not get fixed as a side effect of moving constants.

**Release process:** one PR, the existing gates (`npm run check --prefix web`, MCP typecheck,
tests, `check:tool-count`, `check:wiki`, `check:protocol-resources`, `smoke:dist`, protocol
check), plus three new parity tests: `mcp/test` deep-equals the constants the server uses against
the module; `web/test` asserts `HATCHES.map(h => h.id)` equals `HATCH_IDS` and the canvas's
rotation equals `nextHatchId`; `protocol/test` asserts the legacy schema's `const` equals
`TAKEOFF_SCHEMA`. Bundle size compared before and after with `--analyze` (expected: `store.js`
leaves the graph).

**Exit for the increment (met in 0.9.85; `store.js` out of the graph and `stamps.js` with it, 38 engine files → 37, 846.8 kB → 846.7 kB):** both surfaces import the module, the three parity tests pass on
both CI platforms, `dist/server-core.js` no longer contains `store.js`, no quantity, palette,
hatch or schema value differs from today, and the stale repo-guide sentence is corrected (that
edit changes the packaged wiki and rides the same MCP version bump).

## After that

1. Document read/write — **shipped in 0.9.86.** `web/src/lib/takeoffDocument.js` is the one
   writer; the canvas passes its state bag and the server its field bag, and the envelope rules
   live once. The server adopted the app's conventions (three visible differences, listed in the
   changelog) rather than the builder growing a mode flag. `created_at` decision: the server now
   stamps minted conditions as the canvas does. Round-trip tests on both sides: the app's reader
   lands the server's document losslessly and a fresh session reproduces it byte-for-byte.
2. Dependency declarations: one place for the engine's runtime package ranges, so `@turf/*`
   cannot drift between `web` and `mcp` again.
3. DOM seams in shared `.js` modules: move `downloadText` and `downloadBytes` beside their
   callers, and put the shared `.js` files under a type gate.

None of these is started here.

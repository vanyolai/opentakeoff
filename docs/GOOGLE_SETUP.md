# Google setup — team cloud mode (one-time)

This is the operator's guide for turning on OpenTakeoff's **optional** team-only
cloud mode: Google sign-in plus a shared Google Drive. It's a one-time setup,
done once for the whole team.

None of this changes the default app. Anonymous visitors keep the local-only
browser experience—no account, no upload, nothing here required. Signing in
only unlocks the shared-Drive mode for your crew. All the values you produce
below are **public** (a client id, a domain, folder/file ids) and are safe to
ship in the bundle; the actual access boundary is enforced by Google, not by a
secret. See the security model at the end.

You'll need: a Google Cloud account, and a team that's on **Google Workspace**
(a shared domain, for example, `345flooring.com`). Workspace is what makes the "Internal"
consent screen—and therefore the whole "only our team" guarantee—possible.

---

## 1. Create a Google Cloud project and enable APIs

1. In the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), create a
   project (or choose an existing one)—for example, `opentakeoff`.
2. Enable the APIs the app calls, under **APIs & Services → Library**:
   - **Google Drive API**—reads/writes project files in the shared Drive.
   - **Google Sheets API**—reads tabular per-project data and the pricing feed.

## 2. Configure the OAuth consent screen as **Internal**

Under **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen**:

1. Choose **User type: Internal**, and finish the basic app details.
2. Add these scopes:
   - `openid`
   - `email`
   - `profile`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets.readonly`

**Why Internal is the whole security win.** An Internal app can only be used by
accounts inside your Workspace domain—**Google itself refuses the login** for
anyone outside it. That single setting is what enforces "only our team": there's
no allow-list to maintain and no way for an outside Google account to get
in. Internal apps also **skip Google's app-verification / review** process, even
with the broad `drive` scope, because the audience is your own organization.

> **Least-privilege alternative (future tightening).** The `drive` scope grants
> access to all of a user's Drive. A tighter setup uses `drive.file` plus the
> **Google Picker**—the app then only ever sees files the user explicitly
> opens or that the app itself created. It's more moving parts, so it's noted
> here as a later hardening step rather than the starting point.

## 3. Create an OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Web application)

Under **APIs & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client ID**:

1. **Application type: Web application.**
2. **Authorized JavaScript origins**—add:
   - `https://takeoff.345flooring.com` (production)
   - `http://localhost:5173` (local dev)
3. There is **no client secret** in this flow. OpenTakeoff uses the Google
   Identity Services browser token-client (PKCE-style) flow, which authenticates
   with the public client id and the authorized origin—nothing secret ships in
   the bundle. If Google shows you a client secret, you can ignore it; the
   browser app doesn't use it.
4. Copy the **Client ID** into your build environment:

   ```dotenv
   VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com
   VITE_GOOGLE_HD=345flooring.com
   ```

   `VITE_GOOGLE_HD` is your Workspace domain. It's a sign-in hint, so Google's
   account chooser offers your team's accounts first. It enforces nothing. The
   Internal consent screen is what keeps login to your team.
   See [`web/.env.example`](../web/.env.example) for the full list of variables.

## 4. Create the shared Drive

The app stores everything in the team's own Google Drive—there is no database
of ours.

1. Create a **Shared Drive** named `OpenTakeoff`.
2. Inside it, create a `Projects/` folder.
3. **Share the Shared Drive with your team's Google group** (for example, the group that
   maps to your Workspace domain). Drive's own sharing is what decides who can
   read and write the files—grant it to the team, no wider.

The layout the app expects:

```
OpenTakeoff/ (Shared Drive)
  pricing.json              (synced material costs: material, unit, unit_cost)
  Projects/
    <project folder>/       (one per takeoff project)
      *.pdf                  (plan sheets)
      annotations.json       (the takeoff payload)
      project.json / *.csv   (ingestable per-project data beside the documents)
      proposal.pdf           (generated)
```

Each **per-project folder lives under `Projects/`**, and its Drive **folder id**
is the handle to the project. That folder id is what your Glide project list
deep-links to—`https://takeoff.345flooring.com/?project=<driveFolderId>`—so
opening a project from Glide lands the signed-in user directly in that folder.
See [`GLIDE_INTEGRATION.md`](GLIDE_INTEGRATION.md).

Drop the `pricing.json` file id into `VITE_PRICING_FILE_ID` once the pricing
sync job (also in [`GLIDE_INTEGRATION.md`](GLIDE_INTEGRATION.md)) is writing it.

## 5. (Optional) Enable local-first sync

By default a cloud project is **Drive-canonical**: the canvas reads and writes the
project's `annotations.json` straight to Drive, so every edit waits on the network.

Setting **`VITE_CLOUD_SYNC=1`** at build time flips the whole deployment to
**local-first**: annotations and snapshots become canonical in the browser
(IndexedDB) and sync to Drive in the background. The canvas is instant, survives a
flaky connection, and a project opens from its last local state immediately. PDFs
and the sheet manifest stay Drive-canonical (they're big and team-owned). How the
pieces fit together is in [`SYNC_ARCHITECTURE.md`](SYNC_ARCHITECTURE.md).

```dotenv
VITE_CLOUD_SYNC=1
```

**Roll it out to the whole fleet at once—this is a safety rule, not a preference.**
Only a build with the flag on honors the sync **revision precondition** that keeps
two devices from overwriting each other. A build with it off does an unconditional
write. So if some teammates are on an enabled build and others aren't, the flag-off
clients can silently clobber a flag-on client's edits on a **shared** project. The
flag is therefore **deployment-wide on purpose** (not a per-user toggle):

1. Deploy the enabled build to everyone (one env var—no per-user setup, nothing
   to click). The unit of rollout is the deployment.
2. Until the whole crew is on the enabled build, **don't share a project across a
   mixed fleet.** Solo/unshared projects are always safe; the risk is only two
   people on one project across different builds.
3. **Rollback is one env change + redeploy**—set `VITE_CLOUD_SYNC=` (empty) and
   ship; the app is byte-for-byte back to Drive-canonical, no code revert. Caveat:
   edits made while local-first that hadn't yet pushed live in that browser's
   IndexedDB, so they're invisible to teammates after a rollback until re-pushed
   (inherent to local-first).

Mixed-fleet protection is a *net*, not a guarantee: an enabled client treats a
flag-off teammate's write as an authoritative external edit and **snapshots the
local side before adopting it** (recoverable through the Snapshots panel), rather than
losing it silently. The actual guarantee is the process rule above—flip everyone,
then share.

## Security model

- **The bundle has no secrets.** The client id, the Workspace domain, and the
  Drive folder/file ids are all public identifiers. There is no client secret,
  API key, or database credential in the browser.
- **The Internal app enforces the team boundary.** Google refuses login to any
  account outside your Workspace domain—that, not any code of ours, is what
  keeps the app team-only.
- **Drive sharing enforces data access.** Files are read and written with the
  signed-in user's own Google token; Google checks that user's Drive permissions
  on every call. Access is exactly whoever you shared the Shared Drive with.
- **Access tokens are short-lived and held in memory only.** The browser token
  client obtains a short-lived access token for the session; nothing long-lived
  is persisted.
- **It stays a static site.** Turning this on adds no backend—OpenTakeoff is
  still a static build talking directly to Google's APIs from the browser.

## Troubleshooting

- **A non-domain account can't sign in.** Expected. An Internal consent screen
  rejects any account outside your Workspace domain—that's the feature working.
- **"Access blocked" / "app blocked" on sign-in.** Almost always one of two
  things: the OAuth consent screen isn't set to **Internal**, or the site's
  origin isn't in **Authorized JavaScript origins** (check for an exact match,
  including `https://` and no trailing slash).
- **Sign-in works but Drive calls fail.** Confirm the **Drive API** and
  **Sheets API** are enabled in the project, that the requested scopes were
  granted, and that the user has been shared into the `OpenTakeoff` Shared Drive.

"""The AI adapter contract — the socket you wire a local model behind.

Implement these methods and point OPENTAKEOFF_ADAPTER at your class
(e.g. OPENTAKEOFF_ADAPTER="my_adapters.ollama:OllamaAdapter"). Every method
returns a plain dict matching the response models in app.py, so you can return
partial/empty results safely while you experiment.

Every method is takeoff-scoped on purpose. There is intentionally no estimate,
pricing, risk, or scope surface here.

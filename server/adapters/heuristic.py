"""The default adapter — a transparent heuristic, NO machine learning.

Its job is to make the endpoints work out of the box and to document the
contract, not to be smart. `suggest_scale` does a simple regex over the page
text; `classify_finish` does keyword matching; `detect_rooms` and `parse_schedule`
return nothing and tell you where to plug in a real (vision/OCR) model. Replace
this with your own adapter to bring intelligence to the socket.
